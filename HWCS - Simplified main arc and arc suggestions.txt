- the empire needs to get greater control to completely inact their will


- in most cases, the local people are the last defence because of tradition and custom which might be different to each but plays a role in the harmony"                "- something should be happening in each location that is pulling people away from these traditions, towards division, allowing cracks for the empire to expand secretly through its controlled opposition of democracy

- the chaos god then takes over with pure unrivalled aggression to push rapidly to corruption, acheiving the initial goal of full resonance shift enough that the abyssals can enter the realm"
