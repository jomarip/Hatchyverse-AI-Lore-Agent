we should make an anouncement about it alongside some of the economic decisions

 let me know what you guys think:

for the next phase, 
we will put all NFT trading royalties(gen1, gen2, masters/items etc) as 50/50 - 50% buyback / 50% LP
we have roughly 20% in reserve on msig
staking rewards have increased by 30%

to help grow our collectibles and $HATCHY ecosystem on the near roadmap are:
arcania release (with licensing fees and storefront for nft ecosystem)
masters quests
trading fee of 1% introduced on token trading (used for 50/50 buyback and LP)
Hatchyverse L1
 
Jomari — 10/23/2024 3:06 PM
Not for the tax/royalties on token trading
FloridaMan — 10/23/2024 3:06 PM
LFG!
Sols — 10/23/2024 3:07 PM
it will be a self managed LP so it basically takes the fees we would otherwise give any exchange
[3:08 PM]
@FloridaMan @Jomari is right, its a trading fee on the $HATCHY currency, not for transaction but trading
[3:08 PM]
basically anything on the exact LP we are adding it to, it will all be redirected to boosting the currency

there are many advantages and it makes no difference to any holder imho, im happy to see other opinions about it, 

some simple example is like, even at $1k usd worth of HATCHY, we can earn $10 and use it to buyback about 5% of the days emissions and add it to the LP

it should be a solid formula that only brings benefit to us
[3:12 PM]
it should have a much more significant boost to the currency price than the disadvantage of a trading fee, in most cases I think users are trained to pay the trading fee already, just atm, we arent benefitting from it and instead giving it to a 3rd party, 

I think we give 0.3% to traderJOE atm, and for CEX, if we were on one, i think its usually bit higher,

FloridaMan — 10/23/2024 3:13 PM
So ur saying, we are adding a 1% tax to trading $HATCHY?

Sols — 10/23/2024 3:13 PM
yeah for trading HATCHY on the main LP that we will try to self manage, 
its a tax on trading the currency through that LP - not a tax on sending and receiving the currency

[3:15 PM]
i think it can do a lot to improve the price

FloridaMan — 10/23/2024 3:17 PM
Could also consider setting up a v2 concentrated pool with 1% fee

Sols — 10/23/2024 3:18 PM
yeah probably there is a simple way to do it like that, it would be enough

@Sols

Jomari — 10/23/2024 3:27 PM
So a trading fee on the LP. Please don't use tax/royalties language then. That makes sense and is reasonable

[3:28 PM]
Honestly, I personally would still use an aggregator for lowest swap fees. But I get it. So if you can lock in people to leveraging that option for swaps by having better liquidity or something, it makes sense

So royalties are not going to the DAO anymore? (edited)

Thundaz — 10/23/2024 3:33 PM
interesting stufffff

Sols — 10/23/2024 3:42 PM
yeah the aggregator will always be the best way to trade, they automatically pay that stuff on the trade, i think they calculate post fee trade

@Jomari

Sols — 10/23/2024 3:42 PM
royalties after 300k are meant to be distributed to the DAO yeah
[3:43 PM]
what are we talking about here exactly, the trading fee?

@Jomari
So a trading fee on the LP. Please don't use tax/royalties language then. That makes sense and is reasonable

Sols — 10/23/2024 3:44 PM
good idea! i changed this wording

Jomari — 10/23/2024 3:46 PM
@sols this says all royalties will be used for buyback and lp

Sols — 10/23/2024 3:53 PM
ah yeah i copied some of it from the dev chat, i mean the nft royalties from gen1, gen2, masters, masters items etc

@Sols
ah yeah i copied some of it from the dev chat, i mean the nft royalties from gen1, gen2, masters, masters items etc

Jomari — 10/23/2024 4:06 PM
Cool. That is reasonable. Probably something that should be voted on in a perfect world. But yeah, that makes sense and is a reasonable way to build liquidity and some price support

Sols — 10/23/2024 4:08 PM
the royalties from nfts are owned by the teams that made the nfts, and for the most part it doesnt bring anything in

im not sure if there is room to vote on it, im not against it if so~
[4:10 PM]
and yeah, price support and liquidity can be very useful to us for many reasons, I think whatever we can do to improve it, we should, its one of those things that will benefit us all

[4:11 PM]
since most other bases are covered, this is also maybe the weakest link atm

Jomari — 10/23/2024 4:50 PM
Would they then fall under the DAO royalties as being under the I.P. ? 
Then a vote doesn't matter until over 300k revenue generated.... (edited)
[4:52 PM]
Just on a understanding level, I thought the NFts were the basis of the Hatchy I.P. generation and under the Hatchyverse DAO (quote unquote)

However, it seems that is not the case.

Sols — 10/23/2024 5:03 PM
where are you quoting that from exactly? maybe I need to review it
[5:04 PM]
mostly everything conceptual is ip and basically everything commercialized is product, we intended to keep those separate and keep it consistent to be simpler

Jomari — 10/23/2024 5:04 PM
I was quoting Hatchy DAO not the entire statement lol

Sols — 10/23/2024 5:05 PM
its all redirected to the same place so its kind of same outcome

@Sols

Cool. Learn something new every day

Sols — 10/23/2024 5:07 PM
yeah np, I also just meant any implication of it anywhere is good enough, maybe im mistaking something too, but fwiw, its a small revenue so far from gen1/gen2 etc and its all redirected at hatchy to some degree, was LP, buyback, some kind of dev support etc
