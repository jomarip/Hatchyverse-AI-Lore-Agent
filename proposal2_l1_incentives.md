# **L1 Validator Incentive Structure Proposal**

## **Background**
The Hatchyverse ecosystem is expanding to include an Avalanche L1 chain to provide a more accessible and cost-effective infrastructure for games and services within the Hatchy IP. To ensure network stability and prevent data corruption, we need a minimum of 15 active validators with high uptime.

## **Current Situation**
• Potential package deal: $24,000/year for 5 professionally managed nodes through AvaCloud (valid until end of 2025)
• Current HATCHY token value ($0.001)
• Initial PoA (Proof of Authority) system with potential transition to PoS
• Limited current daily active users 

## **Proposed Incentive Structure**

### **Initial Bonus Program**
• Bonus for first 15 validators who commit to running a node for at least 12 months
• Reward structure: Lower of 750,000 HATCHY tokens OR $750 USD equivalent in HATCHY
• Milestone-based distribution schedule:
  ◦ 10%: Lower of 75K HATCHY OR $75 USD equivalent upon successful node setup
  ◦ 20%: Lower of 150K HATCHY OR $150 USD equivalent after 3 months
  ◦ 30%: Lower of 225K HATCHY OR $225 USD equivalent after 6 months
  ◦ 40%: Lower of 300K HATCHY OR $300 USD equivalent after 12 months
• DAO will sponsor the initial staking requirement: Lower of 1,000,000 HATCHY OR $1,000 USD equivalent
• Total maximum allocation: 12M HATCHY (subject to price-based adjustments)

### **Transaction Fee Structure**
• Dynamic fee structure based on transaction volume:
  ◦ Base fee: Lower of 0.01 HATCHY OR $0.00001 USD equivalent per transaction
• Volume-based reduction:
  ◦ First 1M monthly transactions: 100% of base fee
  ◦ 1M-5M monthly transactions: 50% of base fee
  ◦ 5M-10M monthly transactions: 25% of base fee
  ◦ 10M+ monthly transactions: 10% of base fee
• Distribution of fees:
  ◦ 70% to active validators (distributed monthly based on performance)
  ◦ 30% to DAO reserve for future validator incentives
• Monthly minimum guarantee during first year: Lower of 167K HATCHY OR $167 USD equivalent in total validator rewards
• Monthly rewards only distributed to validators meeting performance requirements

### **Annual Staking Rewards**
• Total annual reward pot: Lower of 2.5M HATCHY OR $2,500 USD equivalent
• Distributed quarterly to active validators meeting performance criteria
• Individual validator rewards calculated as: (Total Pot × Individual Uptime %) ÷ (Sum of All Qualifying Validators' Uptime %)
• Scaled based on uptime percentage (minimum 95% required)
• Validators must maintain performance requirements for full quarter to receive rewards

### **Performance Requirements**
• Minimum 95% individual validator uptime requirement
• Network-wide uptime target of 99.9% through redundancy
• Real-time uptime monitoring and reporting
• Monthly performance reviews with potential reward adjustments
• Validators must stake 1,000,000 HATCHY tokens ($1,000)
• 30-day notice required before withdrawing from validation
• Maximum 4-hour recovery time objective (RTO) for any outages

### **Infrastructure Requirements**
• Minimum 16GB RAM (8GB absolute minimum)
• 8 CPU cores (4 cores absolute minimum)
• 100GB+ SSD storage
• Port 9651 must be open and properly configured
• Redundant network connectivity
• Backup power systems recommended

### **Infrastructure Diversity Suggestions**
• No more than 20% of validators should use the same cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
• Geographic distribution requirements:
  ◦ Maximum 30% of validators in any single geographic region
  ◦ Minimum presence in 3 different continents
  ◦ No more than 40% of validators in any single country
• Mix of infrastructure types:
  ◦ Cloud-hosted validators (max 60% of total)
  ◦ Bare metal/dedicated servers (min 30% of total)
  ◦ Optional: Self-hosted infrastructure (up to 10% of total)

### **Monitoring and Reporting**
• Real-time validator health monitoring
• Automated alerting system for performance issues
• Monthly uptime reports to DAO
• Quarterly performance audits
• Public dashboard for transparency

### **Cost Analysis**
#### **DAO-Operated Nodes (5 nodes)**
• Annual cost: ~$30,000
• Infrastructure management overhead
• Centralization risks

#### **Community-Operated Model (15+ nodes)**
• First year cost breakdown:
  ◦ Initial bonus program:
    ‣ Per validator: Lower of 750K HATCHY OR $750 USD equivalent
    ‣ Total for 15 validators: Lower of 11.25M HATCHY OR $11,250 USD equivalent
  ◦ Annual staking sponsorship:
    ‣ Per validator: Lower of 1M HATCHY OR $1,000 USD equivalent
    ‣ Total for 15 validators: Lower of 15M HATCHY OR $15,000 USD equivalent
  ◦ Annual staking rewards:
    ‣ Total reward pot: Lower of 2.5M HATCHY OR $2,500 USD equivalent
    ‣ Distribution: Proportional to validator uptime percentage
  ◦ Transaction fees (variable based on volume):
    ‣ Minimum guarantee: Lower of 2M HATCHY OR $2,000 USD equivalent
    ‣ Maximum annual pool: Lower of 30M HATCHY OR $30,000 USD equivalent
• Benefits:
  ◦ Greater decentralization
  ◦ Reduced operational overhead for DAO
  ◦ Scalable cost structure for high transaction volumes
  ◦ Protected from token price volatility in both directions

## **Implementation Timeline**
1. Month 1: Open validator applications and begin selection process
2. Month 2: Initial validator selection, infrastructure verification, and setup
3. Month 3: Launch network with minimum 15 validators
   • Initial 10% bonus distribution upon successful launch
   • Begin monitoring performance metrics
4. Month 4-6: First quarterly performance review
   • 20% bonus distribution to qualifying validators
5. Month 7-9: Second quarterly performance review
   • 30% bonus distribution to qualifying validators
6. Month 10-12: Final quarterly performance review
   • 40% bonus distribution to qualifying validators

## **Success Metrics**
• Maintain minimum 15 active validators
• Network uptime >99.9% (measured across all validators)
• Transaction processing time <1 second
• Monthly growth in transaction volume
• Zero unplanned outages
• 100% successful monthly validator audits

## **Future Considerations**
• Automatic adjustment of HATCHY rewards based on token value changes
• Introduction of delegation system
• Development of additional validator incentives tied to ecosystem growth
• Implementation of archival node system for state recovery

## **Economic Impact**
Given current HATCHY value ($0.001):
• Each validator's maximum first-year earnings:
  ◦ Bonus: Lower of 750K HATCHY OR $750 USD equivalent
  ◦ Transaction fees: Lower of 2M HATCHY OR $2,000 USD equivalent (capped)
  ◦ Staking rewards: Share of 2.5M HATCHY total pot based on uptime performance
• Program cost scales with network usage
• Built-in fee reduction for high volume
• Protection against token price volatility in both directions
• No upfront staking cost for initial 15 validators

## **Voting**
This proposal requires a majority vote from HATCHY token holders to proceed.

### **Voting Options**
• Yes: Implement the proposed validator incentive structure
• No: Maintain current structure and explore alternatives

## **Resource Requirements**
Initial maximum allocation from the DAO reserve for first-year operations:
• Bonus program: Lower of 11.25M HATCHY OR $11,250 USD equivalent
• Sponsored staking: Lower of 15M HATCHY OR $15,000 USD equivalent
• Annual staking rewards: Lower of 2.5M HATCHY OR $2,500 USD equivalent
• Additional reserve for high-volume scenarios: 28M HATCHY
• All allocations adjusted based on token price at time of distribution

## **Risk Mitigation**
1. Quarterly review of validator performance
2. Emergency backup nodes maintained by the DAO
3. Regular adjustment of incentives based on network usage and token value
4. External archive state drive for recovery purposes
5. Monthly validator performance reviews with potential for bonus adjustments
6. Automated failover testing requirements
7. Required disaster recovery plans
8. Geographic redundancy requirements

### **Penalty Structure**
• Validators falling below 95% individual uptime face graduated penalties:
  ◦ First occurrence: Warning and 25% reduction in rewards for the month
  ◦ Second occurrence: 50% reduction in rewards for the month
  ◦ Third occurrence: Removal from validator set with 30-day cooldown period
• Immediate removal for:
  ◦ Critical security breaches
  ◦ Malicious behavior
  ◦ Extended unplanned outages (>24 hours)
  ◦ Violation of infrastructure diversity requirements
