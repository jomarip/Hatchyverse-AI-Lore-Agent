Prophecy
The Enigmatic Prophecy of Ages
"Where light and shadow court the dawn,
Two souls of night and day are born.
The great watcher weeps under moon's scorn,
As mountains spring from sorrow torn.
In lands divided, a beast shall wake,
With roar to call the earth to quake.
A tree of ash will mark the stake,
Where light and dark their thirst shall slake.
A crown of stars, in darkness dipped,
Shall bind the rift where time has slipped.
And from this chasm, truth is ripped,
As unity's vessel, once cracked, is sipped.
By prophecy’s end, when all seems lost,
The fractured lands shall count the cost.
Yet in this ruin, the lines uncrossed,
Reveal the dawn, in frost embossed."
[when the sun rises from the west] or some idea relating to
- refers to an ancient sundial now a relic considered useless




Interpretation and Events
* Statue Weeping: Suggests an event of great sadness or disaster that seems impossible until it occurs—a statue near a mountain becomes the epicenter of an engineered flooding event. The weeping statue, initially a metaphor, becomes literal when water sources, manipulated by magic or technology, cause the statue to appear as if it's crying.
* Spring Forming in the Mountain: Following the disaster, the land heals in unexpected ways. The "weeping" leads to the creation of a new spring in the mountain, symbolizing rebirth and the unexpected positive outcomes from hardship.
* Beast Awakening and Earthquake: This part foretells the awakening of a powerful creature, long dormant, whose roar causes an earthquake. This event, cryptic at first, becomes a pivotal moment that unites factions against a common threat, symbolizing the unforeseen challenges that prompt unity.
* Tree of Ash Marking the Stake: A seemingly dead tree becomes a significant landmark following a great battle or sacrifice. Its presence marks a turning point in the conflict, symbolizing resilience and the potential for new growth from the ashes of destruction.
* Crown of Stars in Darkness: Refers to a moment of leadership or a crucial decision made during a time of great despair. The "crown" could be a metaphor for authority or a pivotal discovery that offers a way to mend the fractured reality.
* Unity's Vessel: Implies that the concept of unity, once thought to be broken or lost, becomes essential for survival. The "vessel," perhaps a literal object or an alliance, becomes the key to overcoming division.
* Dawn in Frost Embossed: The final line foreshadows the hard-won peace that follows the turmoil. The new beginning is precious and fragile, like frost under the first light of dawn, suggesting that the unity achieved is to be carefully preserved.
This prophecy, rich with cryptic events and imagery, invites interpretation and speculation, driving the narrative forward as characters and readers alike strive to understand its meanings. The unfolding of each event adds a layer of complexity to the story, reinforcing the themes of unity, resilience, and the cyclical nature of destruction and rebirth.




Hatchy World Contextual info


Hatchy general details:
* hatchy and all life have a spirit
* Some hatchy are very combative or competitive
   * They can be aggressive, territorial etc
   * They can sometimes like battle and competition
      * They like to be trained and powered
      * They like praise etc
* caught or hatched hatchy 
   * hatchy can be caught by being weakened and attacked a special way with enchanted items or magic to be sealed away into the summoner's realm* through the magical item and can be summoned at will by the summoner
      * magical items can be swords, shields, boxes, etc enchanted with magical gems or imbued with magical power
      * many items are left over from the ancients but there are some people who still know how to create these magical items
   * when a hatchy is killed, 
      * It may leave behind a spirit essence or essence shard which can be used to summon the hatchies spirit in a weakened state
         * The hatchy spirit can be powered up
         * when a hatchy is summoned, it will start to show a seal around it, which also acts like a fingerprint for the summoner
   * egg which will eventually hatch into a baby version of that hatchy (Its hard to kill normal pure hatchies, and when killed, they produce these results, corrupted hatchies must be killed through being stabbed in the heart with the Omni-Sword to be cleansed and claimed, any other means of killing the corrupt hatchy results in the hatchy being lost forever)


*the summoners realm is a manifestation of the summoners consciousness, and the hatchies are taken there
* hatchies can have an affect on the summoner while not summoned on the physical realm and in their consciousness, such as the baphomet affecting lucius mind
   * Hatchies can communicate with the summoner in their realm, showing them their memories and what they have witnessed
* More powerful hatchies that are regarded more as demi-deities can affect the summoner’s psyche and thoughts, however, this depends on the strength of the summoner’s will.
The elemental spirit can rebirth the hatchy turning it back into an egg, making it rebirth closer to perfection as the hatchies were once created, and strengthening the bond between the summoner/master and the hatchy, giving the summoner special skills when their hatchy is with them
* Alazar rebirths solarion at the plant spirit temple 
—
The egg is like final fantasy VII materia (The Summoning Materia, not the normal ones)
Hatchy can be weakened and absorbed into Magical ObjectsA kind of pure Materia is created on omni-sword when energized at temple (Or it can glow in the color of the element)


—
Hatchies are not as strong as they used to be, as the people forget the omni, the elemental powers are dying, so is their elemental ability, a lot of the world has forgotten hatchy were ever fantastic and see them as pests or beasts,

Card capture: 
Card summoners are able to use magical cards imbued with the power to capture hatchy elemental monsters. These cards could be used to "summon" the creatures to the character's side, and the character might collect and trade these cards as part of their hobby or profession.


Seal: 
There are many different forms of seal items in the world from orbs, or ancient containers to some magical scrolls or tomes that are able to provide a similar function


Seal spells can trap a hatchy elemental monster within a magical container or prison. This can be used to contain and control the monster, or to prevent it from causing harm


Summoning Stone
Rare and Ancient Crystalized magical stones which hold their own realm are like a paradise inside for the hatchy monsters which are likely to be more easily lured in and captured using the stones


Spirit bind:
A very rare way to summon that only the rarest more powerful sages are able to perform, so rare its not believed to exist,


Spirit binding absorbs the monster into spirit realm and consciousness of the summoner so Spirit binding is considered dangerous as it can cause mental instability in a summoner that doesnt have strong enough will to control the monsters they have bounded with, and those monsters are able to affect the wizards mind while sharing their spirit realm ( Solarion is spirit bound to alazaar by his father from birth, and used to be bound to alazaar’s father originally)






Masters


Masters are specific individuals who are naturally paired with one or more Hatchies.


When a person become a Master, a mark called Signum appears on their body, and this reacts to specific Hatchies that can resonate with them.


Masters can be regular individuals, adventurers, doctors, musicians or even ill intended people.


Powers of the Masters


An hatchy is a physical entity on the plane from the moment they are born, until they pair with a Master. 
At that point they gain their spiritual abilities like Hatcheons had once, and they are capable of simply being carried in the body of the Master through the Signum, and capable of being summoned at command.


Pairing with an Hatchy gives also temporary power to the Master who is now sharing their soul with, this allow the possibility of casting spells and other skills but also transforming themselves. 
Hatchies on their side can also become way stronger and surpass their limit.


Master types
These types of master relationships define the way the people in that area treat their hatchies
   * Refrainers
   * Some people avoid relying on hatchy and consider using hatchy as a form of slavery and reliance and shun the use of hatchy in that way
   * Tamers
   * This group believes hatchy should be tamed and trained and avoids changing the natural form of the hatchy
   * techies/mechies
   * This group believes in augmentation and pushing the biological limits of themselves and their hatchy
   * Extractors
   * This group believes in survival of the fittest and that all other beings are there for their risk or their benefit, they try to take the most from each thing and will destroy a hatchy or another master for their soul essence crystal or loot at any opportunity 
   * Necros
   * The high order sorcerers that use powerful corruption magic to completely dominate the hatchy or other masters


Magic Mechanics
Foundational Law of equal exchange
Magic will always take something
Magicians and summoners will use their energy quickly with even very simple magic
Pushing beyond your means can lead to disease and death
Some people avoid magic altogether
Some people can use the environment, the spirits and their hatchy to

The world Histories, 
- as recorded by great compiler in the great libraries of light


The Genesis of Omni and the Hatchyverse
In the primordial void, an entity of boundless existence, Omni, stirred with the desire to express and witness creation. Omni conjured the Watchers, beings tasked with observing and recording the infinity of creation. Through Omni's luminescence, the Hatchyverse was born, teeming with life and realms beyond comprehension.
Omni, in an act of divine generosity, summoned the Elemental Gods, bestowing upon them seeds of life. These gods, each a guardian of an elemental force, were commanded to nurture life across the Hatchyverse, weaving a tapestry of existence both diverse and harmonious.
The Rise and Fall of Ego
Among the Watchers, one named Ego distinguished himself, earning Omni's favor through his dedication. Rewarded with will and power, Ego's presence was celebrated in creation. Yet, a shift occurred when Omni introduced the huemons – beings of light chosen as guardians over the world and its creatures. Ego, feeling overshadowed and unchosen, harbored a growing resentment.
Convinced of his superiority, Ego challenged the huemons, setting on a path of destruction. His jealousy birthed the doom seed, spawning the Abyssal Army – a legion of intelligence, wickedness, and corruption. Among them, Ego nurtured the Deathbringers, beings of immense abyssal magic, as his elite force.
The War of Elemental Balance
As Ego prepared for war, a prophet warned the elemental gods of the impending chaos. The gods rallied, summoning Titan Guardians to thwart the Abyssal Army. Though victorious, the elemental gods could not vanquish Ego, who, in a weakened state, was sealed away by the prophet, cleaving the earth and leaving his forces leaderless.
The Legacy of Omniterra
In ancient times, the huemons, known as Children of Light, coexisted with nature, elements, and magic. Ego, unable to escape the abyss, influenced the felkyn – a technologically advanced race – to seek Omniterra. This led to a prosperous era of shared knowledge and technology between huemons and felkyn, giving rise to advanced nations.
However, with advancement came competition for power and resources. Nations built weapons of mass destruction, ignoring a prophecy of global catastrophe foretold by a visionary scientist. The scientist, consumed by resentment and ignored by his peers, sought abyssal power, transforming into the Chaos God.
The Order's Shadowy Emergence
As the Chaos God waged war, corrupting even the elemental dragons and titans, a hero united the world against this corruption. The elemental spirits, protecting their temples' crystals, sealed away the Chaos God. Centuries later, the sacred order, knights sworn to protect their homeland, stumbled upon ancient secrets, unwittingly setting the stage for the Chaos God's return.
Modern Times: A World in Shadows
In modern times, the order, now operating from the shadows, seeks to corrupt the elemental temples, unaware that their actions might unleash the Chaos Knight once again.

Ep 2: Omni sword
Call and refusal


Present: After 17 years: ‘Genesis’
      1. Alazar is pressured to go into the forest with some of the other students
      2. A group of teens headed into the thick forest. There is a bright flash and a glow. The boys are compelled to go to the light. Solarion stalks in the shadows.
      3. The boys explain there might be ancient ruins or treasure, and another says they are usually booby-trapped, but they dismiss it as stories to stop people. 


  



      4. The boys come across ominous ancient ruins and are startled away by the Solarion.
      5. The boys split up in fear as one of the boys triggers a booby trap. 


      6. Alazaar pushes them out of the way and is forced in another direction, running away from a rolling stone trap, Alazaar enters a dark corridor with a light opening at the end. 


      7. Alazaar makes his way to the opening and comes across a large open room with the omni sword in stone ahead of him. Alazaar sees a vision of light that tells him about the coming danger and that he needs to pick up the sword, 


      8. As Alazaar tries to pick up the sword, there is a bright flash and a beam of light shoots up, a large thunder can be heard and the area starts to quake and collapse, the voice tells him that its up to him now and to be careful as it fades away,


      9. A shadow approaches slowly from the corridor, the ground shakes as its moving and alazaar is becoming worried in anticipation,  a large corrupted monster appears, 


      10. Solarian jumps up in front of Alazaar Roaring at the corrupted Beast. 


      11. Alazaar with the help of Solarian defeats the beast. As soon as they defeat the beast, the beast vapourizes


      12. The ruins continue to collapse and solarion starts to lead alazaar out of the area and back to the village,


(4 children enter Dark Forest)
1.         4 children who were students from the magic school in the next town came to Dark Forrest through an unusual route. They did not come towards Dark Forrest through the Leaf Temple, but through a meadow that did not belong to the territory of any village or city.
2.         The 4 children joked with each other during the trip, and one of them said that they had done this wrong. They had heard the legend that Dark Forrest was inhabited by high-level Hatchy, making it absolutely impossible for novice wizards or ordinary people to come there.
3.         The other 3 kids just laughed and went on their way. On the way, they did not encounter any significant obstacles. Sometimes they take a break and go back on their way.
4.         They did not realize that during that journey, they were watched from afar by Alazar and Solarion. Alazar, who originally aimed to find a mysterious light coming from the sky, forgot his purpose and was engrossed in observing the 4 children.
5.         The 4 children continued their journey while being followed by Alazar from a distance. They stop when they have reached their destination. The 4 children were in front of a hole that seemed to have just formed. Smoke and a dazzling golden color came out of the hole. Some of them looked happy, but one child was worried and proposed to just go home.
6.         When the 4 children were debating whether they would check into the hole or not, a noise came from the bushes. One of the level 2 Hatchies looks starving and prepares to prey on the young. 3 children looked terrified, but 1 child slightly nervously thrust his magic wand at Hatchy, wanting to put up resistance. He was seen trembling holding his cane.
7.         When Hatchy was about to attack, Alazar from afar immediately threw his weapon. The knife thrown by Alazar plunged into Hatchy's eye, causing him pain. Alazar and Solarion came out of their hiding place and shocked the 4 children.
8.         The hatchy went berserk and chased Alazar, but did not get any significant resistance. Alazar easily played tricks on Hatchy. After being satisfied to play with his opponent, Alazar told Solarion to finish off Hatchy. this is an opportunity for Solarion to vent his fighting desires. The battle was over quickly. The hatchy was killed by Solarion and became his food.
9.         The 4 children were shocked. They were ungrateful, and instead wary of Alazar. Alazar gave the understanding that he was a good person and watched them from a distance. Alazar lied to the them by saying that he lived in Leaf Village. Alazar did not want to divulge his identity as a disciple at Chambra Temple.
10.  Those children believed and were no longer wary of Alazar. Alazar asked them their purpose for going in the direction of Dark Forrest. Alazar asked if they were interested in the light falling from the sky. Alazar suddenly remembered his true purpose for sneaking away from Chambra Temple and going to Dark Forrest.
11.  The children knew nothing about the light that Alazar was referring to. They recounted that they actually took a secret map from their school library room.
12.  Alazar is curious about how the guard system at the school is, and asks if there is no barrier magic protecting the secret room there.
13.  The children said there was a way that turned out to be able to penetrate the magical defenses inside the secret room at school, and it could be done by a Hatchy. They mentioned that they often saw that Hatchy perform a mechanism so that magic couldn't detect it, entering the secret room to take something, and then leaving. There were no alarms or detection devices that warned of anyone entering or leaving the room.
14.  When Alazar wanted to know more, the hole emitting smoke and light apparently collapsed, causing them to tumble into the hole. Only Solarion managed to jump and grab onto a nearby rock.
15.  The four children screamed loudly as they fell, but Alazar found that they were not falling in a conventional manner. Alazar could see them being drawn and tossed, carried into a tunnel filled with light.
16.  They fell right in the middle, but it seemed otherwise. Their bodies didn't immediately crash into the ground. They descended slowly until they found themselves in a large room.
17.  The four children, initially anxious, appeared joyful as they floated in the air while descending. However, Alazar, who had become tense, descended cautiously, holding a knife at his back. The same knife he had used against Hatchy.
18.  Alazar observed the surroundings while the four children wondered if this was the place. Alazar called Solarion's name from the hole where he fell, but there was no response. When one of the children reopened the stolen map from the library to confirm if this was indeed the place, a very loud sound startled them.
19.  One of the stone walls opened, releasing a very loud stone ball that rolled quickly toward Alazar and the children.
20.  Alazar quickly pushed the four children, and they were propelled away. They all survived as the stone ball shattered upon hitting the wall.
21.  Not stopping there, another wall opened, and a similarly sized stone ball rolled quickly towards one of the children furthest from Alazar. Alazar, slightly dazed, swiftly threw his knife towards the stone ball. The nerves in Alazar's hand glowed quite brightly, as if his body was electrified.
22.  The stone ball shattered into pieces upon being hit by Alazar's knife. Alazar was surprised to see this. He was astonished by his own abilities, abilities mastered by the Chambra Temple and Tishi. Tishi, still very young, had already mastered the high-level Tongenkyo.
23.  The child attacked by the stone ball survived. He shielded his eyes from the dust while, at the same time, he saw one of the walls slowly opening. He retreated with difficulty.
24.  Alazar and the children became alert again, but no thunderous sound was heard. What appeared was something shiny behind the smoke.
25.  Alazar approached slowly, trying to shield the children. He walked slowly toward the source of light.
26.  Alazar saw a sword with intriguing carvings. The sword still emitted light, but its glow was diminishing. Alazar, somewhat hesitant, looked back at the four children. They didn't respond; they just watched Alazar from a distance, remaining cautious.
27.  Alazar, carefully observing the sword, suddenly glimpsed an event he had never seen before. At the end of that glimpse, Alazar saw a vision that the light he saw was from this sword. The light precisely stabbed where the sword was. Alazar became convinced that the light he saw was indeed from this sword.
28.  Alazar drew the sword and felt a strange energy flowing within his body. This feeling was different from when he invoked Tongenkyo earlier.
29.  The relief around the room where the sword was located suddenly came to life and emerged. Alazar had seen that creature in a book. It was a level 3 Hatchy.
30.  Hatchy suddenly attacked Alazar, making him jump backward. Alazar, now equipped with a new sword, tried to attack the creature with his new weapon. Unfortunately, the new sword seemed ineffective.
31.  Alazar was somewhat disappointed and could only jump here and there to avoid Hatchy's attacks. Physical attacks like punches and kicks had no effect on Hatchy.
32.  The four children, witnessing the events, tried to help Alazar. They attacked Hatchy with their magical abilities, but Hatchy seemed unaffected. It only pursued Alazar.
33.  Alazar threw away his new sword, hoping that Hatchy would stop its attack. However, it was in vain. Hatchy continued relentlessly attacking Alazar. Meanwhile, one of the children searched for the knife Alazar had thrown earlier to break the stone.
34.  The child found it and immediately threw it towards Alazar. Alazar caught the knife and attacked Hatchy with it. His attacks with the knife proved futile, and Hatchy caught Alazar.
35.  Alazar was gripped and felt intense pain. The magic fired by the children towards Hatchy was ineffective. In that critical moment, Solarion suddenly appeared and bit Hatchy's head, forcing it to release Alazar.
36.  Hatchy roared in pain, but Solarion didn't release its bite. Eventually, Hatchy used both hands to catch Solarion and threw him against the wall, causing Solarion to hit the wall. The wall cracked upon impact.
37.  Solarion was a bit dazed but managed to withstand it. However, it didn't last long because it was attacked again by Hatchy. Seeing this, Alazar instantly became angry and unleashed the full power of Tongenkyo within him, unknowingly.
38.  Alazar, in anger, attacked Hatchy and surprised it. With just his bare hands, Alazar could not only contend with Hatchy but also push it back.
39.  Alazar, who had managed to channel Tongenkyo energy throughout his body, continued to fight Hatchy relentlessly. However, he realized that Hatchy couldn't be defeated with just bare hands. He then picked up the sword that had fallen to the ground.
40.  Alazar took the sword and felt an extraordinary power within his body. He could control the sword perfectly because Tongenkyo energy was combined with the magical energy of the sword.
41.  The sword emitted a blue light, and Alazar immediately swung it, cutting Hatchy in half.
42.  Hatchy was instantly severed and destroyed. However, a bright light emerged from Hatchy's body, resembling an egg, and shot quickly through the wall.
43.  The place began to shake, and Alazar saw signs that it would collapse. He ordered Solarion to prepare. Alazar instructed the four children to climb onto Solarion's back, while he held onto Solarion's tail.
44.  They managed to ascend just as the place finally collapsed and crumbled. They landed on the surface, though with difficulty, and their bodies were thrown off Solarion's back. Fortunately, they weren't severely injured.
45.  But as soon as they stood up, they realized that many Hatchies were surrounding them. They seemed attracted by the mysterious energy emanating from the sword that Alazar carried.
46.  Seeing the numerous Hatchies approaching and realizing they were all in danger, and Solarion couldn't possibly take them away from that place without a fight, Alazar drew his sword.
47.  Something strange happened. Alazar lost consciousness and was able to unleash many magical spells while using the sword. Solarion stepped back a bit. It was as if he didn't recognize Alazar. At the same time, Alazar seemed so enthusiastic about slaughtering dozens of Hatchies attempting to attack him. Alazar appeared to enjoy it, although Solarion knew it wasn't him. Alazar effortlessly slaughtered all the Hatchies without getting hurt.
48.  After all the Hatchies were killed, Alazar, whose eyes had turned white, turned to the four children. The children looked very frightened. But then, Alazar ignored them and turned towards Solarion. He pointed his sword at Solarion, as if indicating that it was Solarion's turn to be killed.
49.  Just as Alazar was about to attack Solarion, he suddenly fell. A small arrow was lodged in his neck. At that moment, Fidelio and several knights from Chambra Temple appeared. Fidelio attacked Alazar because he sensed something was amiss. Alazar had fainted, and his sword slipped from his grasp.
50.  Fidelio and the knights from Chambra Temple took Alazar, Solarion, and the four children away. They headed towards Chambra Temple.

The Forbidden Cavern
      * Alazar discovers the ancient remains of a Titans monument, a technologically advanced race that ruled the world long ago. A memory of his past is triggered when Alazar brushes off a weather-tattered manger’s surface.
      * But a slumbering stone golem ogre awakens from the rock and attacks Alazar. He doesn’t have anything to defend himself and begins to run. He is backed into a corner and just when he thinks its over, Solarion jumps out and defends him. They battle the stone golem, and it is corrupted with strange void energy coming out of it. Alazar knows that is not how it is meant to act. 
      * With powerful light attacks Solarion manages to stun the ogre and momentarily they think they have one, but it gives one last swing and sends them hurtling down a large pit in the cave. 
      *       * Solarion saves Alazar from the fall, and they explore a tunnel illuminated by Solarion’s light.
      * Alazar finds a glowing golden sword embedded in a stone pedestal. The sword marks a golden symbol on his wrist and can disappear and reappear on command.
      * Right as dawn arises, Alazar raises the sword, creating a beam of light that shoots into the sky. Fidelio witnesses the event and rushes to the ruins. It can be seen by miles from many  sources. The Cultists Order( a secret organization of relic collectors) spot the beam as they are planting a void crystal in the earth and change course.
      * Fidelio is furious, that Alazar doesn’t know what he has done. He yells saying that Alazar must leave, fearful of having a relic activated so close to Ishinomori. Alazar doesn’t understand what he has done wrong this time. 
      * All of a sudden they are attack by several void hatchy monsters and Fideleo screams to get back, but Alazar wants to fight with him. Fideleo does not have a hatchy and is getting beaten on all sides by the hatchy. 
      * Alazar decides he needs to jump in and talks with Solarion telling him that he is going to need his help. In a crazy turn of events Alazar feels a strong bond, feeling Solarion’s movements and decisions as his own and together they fight the void hatchy, but while the fight starts well, the tides soon turn. Just when it looks as if it is going bad, we get a cut, to an unknown figure dashing through the woods, he leaps out and intercepts the final blow, summoning a powerful Hatchy. 
      * This figure defeats the void hatchy, and helps Alazar to his feet, introducing himself as Jemma. Alazar is stunned and awed at first by Jemma’s prowess and strength with hatchy summoning. But the awe is quickly disturbed when Alazar tries to help a wounded Fidelio to his feet. 
      * Fideleo smacks Alazar’s hand away and gets angry. He yells at Alazar that this is the last straw. He has been to lenient of him, and warned him not to come here. He has put the whole of Ishinomori in danger and he has no other choice but to exile him. 
      * Jemma is thanked by Fideleo, but told that as one who binds hatchy, he is forbidden from entering Ishinomori. Jemma understands and walks away, but keeps himself close. Alazar and Fidelio return to village with Solarion following them and Alazar is solemnly told by Fidelio that he has to leave, with a hatchie attached to him and relic, he has broken the codes of Ishinomori. But Fidelio loves Alazar as a son, and  gives him Solarion binding stone and pendant.

Exile Path
      * Alazar leaves the village alone. But as he is walking, he gets surprised by Tishi and Rosalie who followed him. They don’t want to leave Alazar to wander the world alone. They want to join him. Alazar tells them about the mysterious cultists.

Alazaar returns to the village. The others have already arrived and started explaining the story to ask for help when alazaar appears, Alazaar heading toward Fidelio’s room and talking to him about the vision of light and a fight against the beast and shows fidelio the omni sword, as they start to try and make sense of it, 






Knights from the order are attacking the village, looking for the sword, they battle with alazar and just as alazar is about to be defeated 


(Leaf Village attacked by Lucius)
      * Alazar quickly recovered after being treated by Fidelio. The four children were in severe shock and wondered where they were. Fidelio informed them that they were in the Chambra Temple. Solarion merely gazed at Alazar, who was not seriously injured after the recent events.
      * As Alazar regained consciousness, Fidelio and several members of the Chambra Temple interrogated him. Alazar honestly answered their questions. One Chambra Temple knight stated that Alazar had violated important rules within the Chambra Temple. Alazar felt guilty for his actions.
      * Meanwhile, the residents of Leaf Village were going about their activities when they suddenly heard loud crashing noises and roaring corrupted hatchy
      * Some are caught by surprise as the corrupted hatchy Hordes of corrupted hatchy swarmed them, they quickly prepared for battle, unleashed their weapons. 
      * Some villagers were easily killed. The situation escalated, prompting the Leaf Village tower guard to sound the bell signaling the village was in danger.


      * Untrained in combat due to their peaceful lives, the Leaf Village residents began to struggle. Their weapons, such as hoes and farming tools, were of little help.


      * the danger alert prompted villagers from the fields and orchards to rush towards the village. The Hatchy they brought for fieldwork joined them.


      * Seeing the villagers and their Hatchy approaching from various directions, lucius could see his swarm starting to get outnumbered


      *  Luscius sent out his champion hatchy and told it to leave no one


      * The battle intensified, but Luscius' side began to dominate due to their specially trained Hatchy. The Hatchy of Leaf Village residents were primarily trained for fieldwork.


      * Alazar and the four children, undergoing interrogation by Fidelio, received news from a Chambra Temple knight that Leaf Village was under attack. Fidelio and other Chambra Temple knights hurriedly prepared to head to Leaf Village. Alazar asked if he could accompany them, and Fidelio allowed it. Meanwhile, the four children were cared for by a knight, and Solarion remained with them.


      * As Luscius and his forces sensed victory, they were startled by something. Many arrows emerged from the dark mist, targeting their Hatchy. Several Hatchy were killed by the arrows, including those with tougher bodies. Luscius was surprised to see regular arrows without any elemental power. This made him uneasy, and fear began to creep in.


      * The battle momentarily stopped as the arrows reappeared, killing some of Luscius' knights and their Hatchy. Those hit by the arrows fell from their horses and died instantly.


      * The troops ordered their Hatchy to attack the thick mist with their unique abilities—fire, light, water, and more.
      * Their attacks penetrated the thick mist, but there was no sign of anything. Luscius waited. Suddenly, from the silence of the mist, several Chambra Temple knights darted forward. They advanced with only weapons, without the aid of horses or Hatchy. Their movements were unique and unlike ordinary combat skills. One Chambra Temple knight even managed to kill several corrupted Hatchy.
      * The battle seemed uneven, but due to the significant number of Luscius' Hatchy, it took more time for the Chambra Temple knights to defeat them all. 
      * Another swarm arrives with the large corrupted hatchy
      * In the critical moment, Luscius ran, taking advantage of the chaos to search for the object he sought. He separated from his comrades and entered a building that seemed to house many items—a warehouse.
      * As he looked around, he began to wonder if the object was inside. Looking towards the door he entered, he saw Alazar standing there.
      * Alazar informed Luscius that he had been watching him and wouldn't let him escape. Luscius laughed, stating he had no intention of fleeing and was searching for the object.
      * Luscius raised his sword, preparing to attack, and Alazar did the same. Alazar opted not to use Tongenkyo as he felt exhausted.
      * When Luscius looked at Alazar's sword, he was shocked. Luscius asked where he got the sword, and Alazar lied, claiming it was his own. Luscius became angry, questioning why a seemingly destitute youth from a distant village possessed a sword associated with luxury.
      * Alazar, not fully understanding Luscius' words, had to engage in combat as Luscius attacked him furiously. They fought inside the warehouse, amidst piles of straw, fruits, and vegetables.
      * Luscius was astonished by Alazar's abilities. Out of anger, he even threw some fruits to deceive Alazar and create an opportunity to attack. Uncomfortable with fighting in such a place, Alazar went outside, and Luscius aggressively pursued him.


Ep 3: Aid


      * A powerful old knight named Jemma arrives claiming to have seen the flash. Jemma has knowledge about the past history and the sword, he asks some questions and realizes it must be the omni sword in serious decayed state, he explains to the boy that the sword chose him and that he must be the one to carry it through its journey,
      *       * After the battle, the elders are gathered and confront fidelio about alazars endangering of the town, Fidelio is regretfully forced to banish alazar,  


  

      * Jemma suggests Alazaar go out on the journey to find the oracle, he explains that the oracle spoke of such an event and that he may know what to do next, 


      * Fidelio explains that he has been holding some things from his birth and gives a pendant with the omni sign and the solarion card to Alazaar, claiming it was with him when he was first found and solarion had always been protecting him 


      * Alazaar and Solarion start their new journey to seek out the oracle.




Jemma's Arrival (Alternate)
• Jemma suddenly arrived by teleportation, immediately halting Luscius's attack on the ailing Alazar.
• Jemma defeated Luscius but allowed him to escape.
• Assisted by Jemma, Alazar was taken to a safe location while the war continued.
• Luscius's escape dampened the spirits of his forces, resulting in their defeat. Ultimately, the Chambra Temple knights managed to contain Luscius's troops.
• Jemma was granted entry into the Chambra Temple due to her good standing with the temple's leaders.
• Jemma explained her reason for coming and shared information about the Omni Sword.
• Jemma stated that Alazar must leave the Chambra Temple forever to complete the power within the Omni Sword. However, Alazar refused, feeling he couldn't survive outside the temple due to his relatively low abilities.
• After a meeting of the Chambra Temple leaders, it was decided that Alazar had violated two temple rules: first, by raising Hatchy, and second, by leaving the Chambra Temple area before turning 17. The final decision rested with Yohak Ballint, the deputy chairman of the Chambra Temple.
• While Alazar's expulsion was largely a formality, he had to abide by the decision.
• At the border of the temple's territory, Fidelio gave Alazar an artifact, explaining that it was present when Alazar was found.
• Alazar and Solarion set out together. Before doing so, they were instructed to go to a specific location to meet a friend of Jemma's. This person would train Alazar in controlling the Omni Sword.


________________


Exile Path (Alternate)
Throughout the journey from Chambra Temple to Leaf Village, Alazar appeared somber. He simply gazed at the Omni Sword at his waist. Solarion, not understanding much, just walked alongside his master. Jemma noticed this and, after a considerable distance from the village, invited Alazar and Solarion to take a short rest by the river.
Jemma invited Alazar to chat and shared a bit about the Omni Sword, as much as Jemma knew. However, it seemed that wasn't what was truly on Alazar's mind. He felt that he had made a fatal mistake. He had violated the rules of Chambra Temple, and suddenly, he had the responsibility to safeguard the Omni Sword.
Jemma noticed someone watching them a few times and after providing motivation to Alazar, stating that it was something he couldn't avoid. Alazar just had to do the best he could. 

Jemma also mentioned that this event was connected to something bigger, but he couldn't disclose the details to Alazar. 

Jemma assured Alazar that his reputation would naturally be restored if this special task could be accomplished by Alazar. 

Hearing this, Alazar's confidence resurfaced. This was his first mission as someone who had trained at Chambra Temple. Alazar accepted the mission.


Once Alazar's confidence had grown, Jemma told him that he had to leave because there was a place he needed to go. Jemma informed Alazar that he had to head to a city to meet someone named Isilron. Isilron was a sword master and an expert in channeling elemental energy into blades. He was also a close friend of Jemma.


Jemma handed Alazar a Hatchy world map since Alazar didn't have one. In the end, they parted ways. Jemma headed down a path that led into the forest, while Alazar and Solarion followed the river's course towards the city where Isilron resided.
Arc 2: Meet the oracle
Ep 4: Journey to oracle
  



      * Alazaar heads off in search of the mountain sage that Jemma told him about. Alazaar and Solarion have some trouble and are bonding through the struggle of climbing up the mountain.


      * Alazaar meets a traveller struggling to navigate her way through the torturous forest canopy, a forest elf that has been lost and Aliya, a Priestess healer girl, explains that she is a Trainee Guardian of the light temple. She is a Holy innocent girl that is able to receive visions that she doesn't fully understand. She also mentions her close relationship with the guardians of The Mirrors of Gaia Higher Temple.


      * The trio go through the mountain to get to the top where they meet the Sage/Oracle, a wise and powerful wizard already prepared for their arrival.


Ep 5: oracle advises


      * The Sage tells them about the world history and explains about the fight with the Omni versus the Chaos God, and his abyssals, the Deathbringer etc

 “In the beginning, The God of Chaos waged war against the Omni. However, the elementals summoned Titan Guardians to battle the Abyssal army and defeat the chaos god. As time passes, the power, knowledge, ancient artifacts and magic is lost. The Oracle explains about the power of the Omni Sword and the energies and says that the only way to restore its elemental powers is to find each Elemental spirit, gain their blessing.”


         * In the very beginning there was only the great egg, the all-one, the Omni,
         * The Omni was consciousness, 
         * Through consciousness the Omni was wisdom, 
         * Through wisdom the Omni was love, 
         * The Omni spoke and through the word it was, 
         * and through being it loved
         * The omni wanted to expand the universe and share blessings of the will,
         * The omni created the harmony and the chaos,
         * Through harmony the planets came together and created many environments
         * Through chaos erupted a changing flow
         * The omni spread life through its light and was pleased
         * The many lifeforms lived in an eb and flow of creation and destruction
         * Harmony and chaos lived side by side
         * complimenting 
         * The once desolate emptiness of void was now full of expression
         * The abyss stirred with resentment
         * As the light became brighter the emptiness became more apparent
         * The abyss felt challenged, threatened by the infinite expression and vowed to destroy everything that was different
         * The abyss started to seep corruption into the world
         * Through his rage, ego created the doom seed, and with it spawned the abyssal army, a race that was incredibly intelligent but wicked and corrupt.
         * The ego favored a devoted group of deathbringers among the Abyssal army and raised them with the most powerful abyssal magic.
         * The prophet emerged and alerted the elementals to the chaos gods' plans.
         * The elementals summoned Titan Guardians to battle the Abyssal army and defeat the chaos god.
         * The elementals join forces and win the battle but they are not strong enough to kill the chaos god. 
         * While he is in a weakened state, the prophet seals him away, cleaving the earth.


        
The Oracle tells them about the ancient history of the world, a little bit more detail than was told in the chambra temple at the beginning, like adding EGO story in more detail here
         * Oracle tells the group that a dark champion is chosen and he is sealed away but they are trying to free him, that given the opportunity and the powerful cursed artefacts he has, he is likely to come back soon and destructively
         * Explains some of the prophecy about


         * The Oracle explains that Alazaar needs to find temples, the homes of the elemental spirits to power the sword with the temples power and seal the chaos Gods.


         *  The chaos god is still sealed away with the power of the elemental temples to hold the seal. That is the only way for peace to continue for society. But he warns Alazaar that he would need immense courage to partake in the journey ahead as the forces of evil are aware of his presence and will do anything to prevent him from succeeding. With this information, the Oracle sends Alazaar to the first temple.


Ep 6: Tavern
*Heroes journey - jumping off point*


         * Team is sent by jemma to meet someone at the tavern
         * The team meets a swordsman who trains them in combat


         * They go to village but ask all over and cannot find a man by that name. When sun is setting, they meet a drunk farmer in a tavern who confronts them about why they are seeking Isilron. Turns out drunk farmer is Isilron but doesn’t go by that name anymore. Alazar and group are shocked that this is the man they are sent to. He tells them to go away, but Alazar persists, and he eventually says they can stay in his barn. 
         * Alazar finds secret room with dusted bondless hatchy summoning stones. 


         * After much convincing, Isilron teaches Alazar and Rosalie the art of summoning. Training begins. Tishi on the other hand begins to study all about hatchys from Isilron’s ancient manuscript. Isilron no longer has any hatchy’s of his own bonded, save for one Bamboozler who helps on the farm. But he was once part of the Golden Dawn order. And he begins to discuss a bit of the lore of the Golden Dawn’s role in upholding the balance between Hatchy and humans. 
         * Alazar reveals his broken omni sword, that doesn’t fully form since first activation. Isilron gets very uncomfortable and tells him never to show that to anyone, that there are people out in the world looking for old relics and it would be best to keep it under wraps. It is a powerful relic weapon, rare, but in bad condition. It can be restored though. Though the true importance of the sword is not yet revealed. 
         * Alazar wants to get to the bottom of this mysterious order, but they are not strong enough to face them yet. His bond with Solarion deepens. 
         * Minions of Lucius, Cultists in dark robes different to lucius’s have tracked down Alazar and they send in hatchy’s to attack. Isilron tells the group to run, that he will hold them off, and we see the true strength of Isilron and his bond to Bamboozler. 
         * Isilron tells them that the sage was once part of the order as well and they will be able to help. In their parting words and group sets off, leaving Isilron behind. 
         * Ends with an fire erupting on the land, and group is not sure what has happened to Isilron. But they are forced to continue onwards. 




Searching for Isilron, the Swordmaster (***This is an alternative story before Alazar meets the Oracle. So the sequence is Tavern, then Oracle)
         1. Alazar and Solarion finally found the village mentioned by Jemma, where Isilron the Swordmaster resided. The village appeared deserted, and as far as the eye could see, there were only vast expanses of wheat fields. Alazar and Solarion began to traverse the wheat fields.
         2. They arrived at a house at the edge of the wheat fields. It was an isolated house. There, they saw someone intoxicated. Alazar approached the person and asked if he knew someone named Isilron, a skilled swordsman.
         3. The individual, a stout man with an unfriendly countenance, appeared intoxicated. He looked at Alazar with an unfriendly gaze, questioning why he entered his wheat fields. Alazar once again explained his reason, stating that he wanted to find Isilron.
         4. Enraged, the man stated that he did not know anyone by the name of Isilron. He then threw an empty wine bottle at Alazar, who easily dodged it.
         5. Solarion, visibly angry at how Alazar was treated, began to growl. However, Alazar calmed Solarion down and asked the man where the village center actually was. Perhaps he could ask the villagers there.
         6. The intoxicated man, feeling somewhat pressured by Solarion's presence, reluctantly showed the way to the village center. Alazar and Solarion set off together. However, to avoid attracting too much attention, Alazar thought he would leave Solarion at a certain location.
         7. Alazar and Solarion headed towards a hill near the wheat fields. He instructed Solarion to rest there. From atop the hill, Alazar could see where the village center was. He also looked around. He gazed at the house of the drunk man for a few moments, as if ensuring something, and then headed towards the village center.


Tavern
         1. Alazar arrived at the village center and inquired about Isilron from several villagers he met. He also asked the village chief, but the chief claimed he never remembered having a villager named Isilron. The village chief also mentioned that occasionally a swordsman was seen in the village, but he didn't know if it was the same person or not, as it could be just a wandering swordsman.
         2. Confused by the lack of answers, Alazar entered a tavern. He felt somewhat hungry. He then sat at a somewhat secluded spot. The tavern keeper then approached Alazar, asking what he would like to order. When about to order, he suddenly remembered the money given by Jemma. It was only a small amount. He thought about Solarion, who might also be hungry. Feeling uncomfortable towards the tavern keeper (who is a young woman), Alazar only ordered plain water. He also asked where he could buy a Hatchy storage crystal. The tavern keeper informed him of a shop where he could purchase the crystal.
         3. The tavern owner, who was also in the tavern, asked his staff why Alazar only ordered plain water. The server honestly stated that Alazar didn't have enough money to buy food and beer because he wanted to buy a Hatchy storage crystal. The tavern owner then looked at Alazar from a distance with a cynical gaze.
         4. However, the tavern owner suddenly became interested in the sword Alazar carried. Even though the Omni Sword was covered with cloth, the hilt of the sword was still visible.The tavern owner felt that it was no ordinary sword. He had never seen a sword hilt like that before. He also didn't recognize the sword pattern.
         5. The tavern owner then approached Alazar and asked about the sword he was carrying. Alazar lied, coming up with the most reasonable excuse in his opinion, but the tavern owner didn't believe him and began to press Alazar with many questions. He also said he would buy Alazar's sword, but Alazar refused.
         6. Uncomfortable, Alazar quickly paid for his drink and was about to leave the tavern, but it turned out that several people were blocking the tavern door. These people turned out to be the tavern owner's henchmen and wanted to take the Omni Sword from Alazar. The tavern owner told Alazar that if he didn't hand over his sword, his henchmen would resort to violence against him. Alazar held his sword with one hand and challenged the tavern owner's henchmen to fight with only one hand.
         7. The angry henchmen then attacked Alazar, causing chaos in the tavern. However, in a corner of the room, a man appeared calm and observed the fight carefully.
         8. Alazar easily defeated the tavern owner's henchmen with just one hand. He then left. In a somewhat deserted alley, Alazar stopped. He then looked back, seeing someone behind him. Alazar asked the person why he was following him. Alazar asked if he was also ordered by the tavern owner to take his Omni Sword. The person said he just wanted to test the sword. Alazar invited the person to attack him, but when Alazar dodged, the person easily followed Alazar's movements. Alazar was stunned, and he quickly drew a small sword from his waist. But the person was already behind Alazar, holding Alazar's hand that was holding the small sword.
         9. Alazar was amazed by the person's ability to conceal his presence. The person then smiled and said that he had been following Alazar since the wheat fields. This made Alazar even more surprised.
         10. The person then leaped away and removed the covering hat he was wearing. He asked if Jemma sent Alazar away. Alazar felt a little hesitant. The person then said that he is Isilron.
         11. Happy to finally meet Isilron, they then left together. Along the way, Isilron explained that he used an alias in this village and rarely left his residence.
         12. They walked towards the hill to fetch Solarion and went towards the wheat fields. Alazar asked why they were heading towards the wheat fields, towards the drunkard's house. Isilron said that he lived in the basement of that house.
         13. When they arrived, the drunkard seemed slightly sober and immediately recognized Isilron. He then stood up and saluted. Isilron then explained to Alazar that this house actually belonged to the drunkard, but for some reason, he allowed Isilron to occupy his basement. The drunkard was also the only person who knew Isilron's real name and was tasked with driving away anyone who sought him.
         14. Alazar said that when he was around the house, he felt a strange energy. When on the hill, he checked again, but there seemed to be nothing strange about the house, so he left immediately. Isilron explained that the strange energy came from the collection of swords in the basement, which was connected to Alazar's Omni Sword. Isilron felt a very strong energy in front of the house, so he tried to confirm and followed Alazar.
         15. Isilron then asked Alazar to show Omni Sword and swing it. Alazar uncovered the Omni Sword and tried to swing the sword, but then his hand felt numb. Isilron borrowed Omni Sword from Alazar. When he tried to hold the sword, there was a strong pressure on him. He then handed the sword back to Alazar.
         16. Isilron told Alazar as he suspected, that the sword rejected anyone other than Alazar. He also said that he didn't know where Omni Sword came from and what it was made of, but one thing was for sure, Omni Sword was very strong, and its owner must have something special.
         17. Alazar looked despondent. He asked if Isilron couldn't teach him how to use Omni Sword. Isilron then invited Alazar to the basement, to the place where he lived with his sword collection. In the basement, Isilron said that even though he couldn't use Omni Sword, he could train Alazar in using sword energy and performing secret techniques with each sword. This had to be trained gradually.
         18. Alazar agreed to train. Starting from that day, he would become Isilron's student and stay in the warehouse behind the house, along with some Solarions and some livestock.
         19. As a sign of Alazar being accepted as a student, Isilron gave Alazar a Hatchy storage crystal. Alazar didn't have to worry about how to bring Solarion along, and Isilron also joked that if Solarion was stored in the Hatchy storage crystal, then the livestock in the warehouse wouldn't be frightened. So that day, Alazar officially became Isilron's student and would stay in the village for a while.

Arc 4: Water temple - destroyed ancient airship?


________________




Version:
Corrupted Waters:
         * Journey to water temple. On the other side of the icy mountain peaks the group can just make out the distant grand lake where the map marks an ancient sacred site in the middle of the great Nagim Kingdom.
         * Aliya and Sprout both decide to stay along for the journey. They make their way down the mountain and are heading towards it. 
         * Meanwhile we begin to explore Lucius’s story. After the defeat at the City of Aelimore Lucius is chastised by the Elder who speaks to him through a dark orb. He is burdened by his failures but determined to prove himself. While the Knights are ordered by Elder to pursue with their own objectives, Lucius tracks the group using his equally significant Hatchy that should be as rare and strong as Solarion. 
         * Explore character. Driven by a destiny that has been set out for him by the order, but not one he necessarily wants. He claims great peace and focus in the void, and we see for the first time that there is actually beauty in void magic and the bond he shares with his hatchy. 
         * He defeats the Sasquatch with no problem and finds his way through the ice tunnels to the Oracle. She gives him a prophecy of his own. 
         * We see through Oracle the vision of the being that Lucius has been designed to bring into the world, and the potential devastation it could cause. We see leylines turning to void energy. End with Lucius standing at the top of the mountain, looking down towards the Nagim Kingdom a crystal planted behind him, and slowly seeping into the earth. 
         * Cut to the Alazar group having fun and bonding as they share food with one another and their hatchys, whilst Sprout can sense something is coming. A contrast of the two main protagonists, despite having come with similar origins on separate sides of the coin.
         * As group grow closer to the great lake of the Nagim Kingdom, they realize that things aren’t quite right. 
         * They decide to set their sites for the great lake, and while on the way they notices that there are dried up river beds. Some of the villages they pass are overheated and dry, with a sludge-mud-like water slowly gurgling through. 
         * They try to buy food in the villages but all the fish are polluted and tainted, and there is nowhere to get clean water. They end up staying in one of the ins. Tishi gets sick from drinking some of the tainted water.
         * They try their best to heal him, but it is not something that can be easily healed. Aliya has heard that the people of the Great Lake are meant to be great healers and should know what to do. But they are confused, as this region of the world was meant to boast clean rivers, and thriving villages, who all operated around the economy and life that the waters provided. They know something is very wrong. 
         * The people of the villages warn that according to their King, the water issues have been caused by the Artarian pirates, who have been trying to disseminate the Nagim Kingdom’s power. There is an age old fight over claim to the waters and the land around it. 
         * Main group decides that they want to help these people and defeat the pirates.


________________


The Artarian Interception 
         * Main group is on their way through the now polluted and muddy marshlands. Most of the water has dried up and Tishi is getting more sick. They decide they need to get him to the sacred spring in the centre of the Nagim Kingdom and hope that the healers there can do something about it. 
         * As they are on their way, they are intercepted by a group of pirates. The pirates have questions of their motives, but fueled by the information they were fed by the villagers, main group believes the Pirates to be enemies and engage in combat. 
         * They manage to defeat the first wave of pirates, but then one of their leaders appears with reinforcement. He is a powerful presence and strong leader, Roni. 
         * The group knows they are outnumbered but they still poise themselves to fight, yelling out that what the Pirates are doing to the waters is wrong and that villagers are dying and their friend is sick. Alazar demands that they stop rerouting the water. 
         * That is when Roni halts the attack. He asks more questions about what Alazar and the group are doing here, and inevitably says that he needs to show them something. 
         * Main group are escorted by the Pirates to a tall vantage point, where they are shown a massive dam construction. Roni reveals that it is not them who are blocking the waters, but the Nagim King. The King has been lying to his people, and putting the blame on them. The pirates have been fighting the Nagim for as long as they can remember. But the dams are strong and heavily guarded. It takes a lot of resources to orchestrate an attack on the dams and while the Pirates do their best, the Nagim Kingdom’s military is too powerful. 
         * King is revealed to be re-routing natural water flows for some hidden agenda, causing water levels to drop and poisonous algae to form on the little water left.
         * With this realisation Alazar and group understand that the pirates are actually the good guys. The Artarians inhabited this land thousands of years ago, but when the Nagim came from the southern oceans, they conquered the Artarians homeland and began bending the waters to their own will. There was a time when the Artarians lived in harmony with the waters, and they hold it very sacred. What the Nagim King is doing is sacrilege to them. 
         * Alazar says that they will help them, but Tishi needs healing.
         * Artarian Pirates say that without the water from the sacred spring, there is little they can do, but at least they can hold back Tishi’s sickness, keep it at bay. What the pirates really need is help taking down the dams, and reclaiming their homeland around the sacred spring.

         * They are helped by the good Artarians and make way to the desert, splitting with the other guys 


________________


         * Alazar and the main group are taken on a boat and led through a jungle-like riverway and end up in a secret cove, one that is half covered in stone, like a massive cave, with buildings and wooden bridges inside. A couple of the houses cling to the cliff-face outside the cave, and there is a small port somehow veiled by a strange mist that surrounds the area. 
         * The main group is taken through the port town and characters will get to explore the town. There is a tavern where one can play some Artarian games. There are even certain guild opportunities. 
         * While the main group is there, another ship comes in and it is men and women delivering supplies to help the Artarians survive. Alazar recognises a symbol on the crates. It was the same symbol that Jemma had on his sword. 
         * Alazar asks Roni what the symbol is, and Roni tells Alazar that it is the symbol of the Golden Dawn, an organisation the Artarians have been allies with for generations. 
         * All of a sudden a woman comes swooping down from above, twirling and flipping from rope, to bridge, etc. She lands right before them and puts her arm around Roni. It is his sister Shanti. She is charismatic, full of energy and positivity, which is almost the opposite of her serious and focused brother Roni. 
         * Together they share a feast and Alazar talks with Roni and Shanti more about what’s going on. They reveal that they have a raid planned a sabotage plan. It involves stealth, and they want to create weak points in all the dams, so that they can take them all down at once. 
         * Alazar wonders what that will do to the villagers, wont it create a flood? This is when we see the character traits shift. Roni wants to evacuate the villagers, where as Shanti gets very venomous. She hates the Nagim, all of them, regardless of whether they are working with the king or not. For generations the Nagim have treated her people like scum, and she wouldnt mind seeing them all get wiped away by the flood that would ensue from taking down all the dams at once. 
         * Alazar decides that it might be best if they could show the villagers the truth. That they are innocent people, being fed lies by the King. They could weaken the dams as planned, but find a way to integrate the Nagim villagers into a better way of life. 
         * Shanti says that Nagim and Artarians could never live together peacefully. We begin to see a divide within the Artarian’s. There are those who are more loyal to Roni, honorable pirates, who fight only to save the innocent and wish to reclaim their homeland with as little blood shed as possible. Then there are those who are loyal to Shanti. They steal, pillage, and raid villages. They don’t have a filter, and will stop at nothing to reclaim whats theirs. (Possible that one could choose an allegiance in a game scenario - either going with Roni’s plan, or Shanti’s. Either way will end with Nagim King defeated, but the journey getting there will be different with a potential for different cut scenes as well.) Integrate more Lore about an ancient cataclysm that made civilisation reset and cost the Artarians their homeland when the Nagim invaded, forced to move by rising sea levels drowning their old Kingdom. Also time to integrate with the Nagim Prince working alongside them, that he thinks his father has been consumed by void forces, foreshadow for the voidmancer. 
         *  Just when the group thinks they are going to rest after the pirate night of revelry, they begin to see ranks forming. The artarians need to attack the dams at night, right during the change of shifts. They will create weakpoints, ones that aren’t noticeable, but when struck correctly could collapse the entire dam. Alazar and team have to choose how they want to help. 
________________


Attack on the Waterways:
        
         * The raid on the waterways begin and using stealth the Artarians and available group go to the dams and weaken the structures. They don’t fully destroy it yet because they need to plan a coordinated attack. A launch on the main Nagim city, and a disruption to the dams. The sabotage takes most of the night. 
         * Alazar still doesn’t reveal his true nature or that they are searching for the ‘Hydro-nexus’. They say that they will infiltrate the Nagim Kingdom to the best of their ability with Nagim prince (though they don’t know who he is yet) to try and stop the diversion of the water flow.
         * In the early hours of the morning they return to the Artarian port town and discuss their main attack on the capital. 










Hydro-Nexus
         * Alazar is woken up by Rosalie who says that Tishi is getting worse. She tells Alazar that they need to get the sacred spring water as soon as possible. So Alazar and main group decide to set out and infiltrate the Nagim stronghold before the Artarian’s plan their attack. Rosalie stays behind with sick Tishi. 
         * There is a secret underwater tunnel network and group gets ability to breathe underwater, as Nagim prince leads them through the tunnel network towards the Nagim Kingdom. 
         * Aliya, Sprout and Alazar find a Hydro-Nexus like structure. They didn’t find the aforementioned ship but, this is suspicious. There are all sorts of Nagim around it. The group cautiously infiltrates the facility to investigate further.
         * They uncover the startling truth that the Nagim King has been unearthing ancient Titan artifacts, driven by a relentless pursuit of formidable weaponry to further his own agenda.
         * The Nagim King is inside and is controlling Hydro-Nexus from the central room, with tubes, sprouting four more arms, as it mutates him. We hear his voice change and we realise that it is not him, but a member of the void order pupetteering him from the inside. Foreshadow to the Voidmancer had how she effects the external world through her invisible webs of influence.  It is controlled with intent and magic as he meditates in a dark bubble of his own. His intention is to drown the world so that he can conquer it and betray the Order, using this power for his own gains. Group manages to jump into the Hydro-Nexus before it seals itself
         * Bottom levels of the Hydro-Nexus quickly fill up with water and group has to swim to safety. Battles with corrupted water hatchys. Figuring out puzzles and navigating to try and get to the centre. 
Meanwhile Lucius reaches Artaria Port Town whilst Artarians are busy with their counter measures, finding Tishi and Rosalie. At first Rosalie tries to fight him off, but he is much stronger than her. 
         * Lucius gets word that the Nagim King has gone against the Order’s wishes and that he should take him out. So he in turn works with the group and he actually helps heal Tishi, expelling the corrupted water. He is not an evil person. He does not see his destiny as Evil, despite what the Order have made of him. He sees the great peace in the void and doesn’t know that the God-like being he is bringing in will be one of destruction. 
         * They go and find little sting-ray like craft that were uncovered in the water Kingdom and with the help of Tishi’s intellect find a way into the Hydro-Nexus
         * Meanwhile pirate group emerges with giant ancient Artarian subnatuical ship  and begins big underwater battle with Hydro-Nexus, trying to stop Nagim King from the outside, but he is extremely powerful. 
         * Main group is in trouble until met by Lucius and Rosalie, and Tishi. Alazar tries to fight Lucius as Alazar is still very angry about the attack on Ishinomori. Rosalie explains that he helped Tishi. They from a resentful alliance to bring down water King. 
         * Arrive in central room and have main fight with Nagim King, who is extremely powerful and controlling the corrupted Frostvern. While it starts good, fight turns sour. End with it not looking good for Alazar team and pirates.
         * Jemma arrives and they cannot defeat the water King until Airship manages to land a crucial blow. It distracts the King enough that they can move in for the final strike. Vimana ship floats up to surface of water. Energy Orb is purified and group gains powers. Nagim prince and pirates undivert water, and lakes and rivers fill up again.
         * This is when Lucius turns on team again. He tries to take Sprout and orders Alazar to hand over the omni sword. 
         * Rosalie feels betrayed as she had bonded with him. He tries to reason with her, as he likes her as well, telling her of the beauty of his plan, for he does not know the truth. He shows her the beauty of the void. But she cannot make up her mind. Jemma tries to convince Lucius that his plan is not what the order is making it out to be. That he is being deceived and that he can choose his own destiny. He does not listen. He puts up a fight, but ultimately Alazar and group manage to overcome him as he is only one man.  
         * We find out true identity of Nagim Prince, who  thanks group for saving the water and is in new responsibility of upkeep the Nagim Kingdom and his alliance with the Artarians. Power is restored to the Artarians and they land their airship in the Nagim Kingdom, reclaiming it for their own. 


*Cut scene*
         * Cast out Lucius is once again confronted by Cultists under Elders orders. He has failed again. They reprimand him and send out powerful void-ritual human-hybrid called the Void Reaper (corrupted guard).
         * That night Rosalie wakes up and finds void hatchy Lucifell. She bonds with it and thinks of Lucius, wanting to be with him, but still feeling torn over her allegiance. 




Artarian Ship 


         * On the Artarian ship Captain of pirates, Artarian leaders, brother and sister duo, Roni and Shanti reveal that they are members of the Golden Dawn and greets Jemma with fond warmness, alluding that Jemma is not from this world, but that they are grateful for Jemma’s help. 
         * Alazar speaks with Jemma who reports that there has been an increase of cultist and corrupted hatchy attacks. They are growing stronger and more powerful, and he wants to post some of the Golden Dawn members to guard the lost pyramid. Find out that their correspondence Roni and Shanti of the Artarians is also a part of the golden dawn. 
         * Alazar is forced to reveal what the oracle told them. Pirates reveal that the artarian airship isn’t up to it’s full power, and that they would post some of their pirates to guard the Hydro-Nexus. 
         * They say that there are still some repairs to be done to the Artarian ship. 
         * Roni and Shanti take main group to Desert area on Ship.

Ep 3: Fire Temple Blessing
Intro:




Conflict: 




Resolution: 


Alternate:
Dry Sea Canyon
         * Alazar and group continue onwards for some time before Jemma splits off from them. Alazar and main team, still divided, head towards the desert where the fire temple is said to be marked on the map. 
         * Team members encounter extreme heat while encountering new hatchy to battle that are enraged from the heat, and cannot use their plant or water magic don’t have the nutrients to blossom anything. They find a canyon with ancient houses built into the stone, and decide to rest there until nightfall, choosing to travel when the sun isn’t out. 
         * Though when it grows dark, strange lights appear in the shadows and Alazar awakes to find someone wearing a tiki-style mask standing over him. 
         * The Doneldune tribe introduce themselves. They are not hostile, but all wear strange carved masks out of volcanic stone. None of them ever seem to take them off. They say that their ancient ancestors used to live here, but in the more recent times the heat has become too unbearable, and they have had to go deeper into the canyons. They reveal that ever since the Nagim King has been redirecting the  subterranean water currents and river that used to flow through the canyon, that they have had to move into the mountain, as well.
         * Meanwhile, Void Reaper kills some golden Dawn members with aid of cultists and invades the Pyramid. Main group does not know about this, and it is left with a cliffhanger. 


Doneldune Mines
         * The group arrives at the village nestled within a vast underground cave adorned with hanging stalactites and interconnected bridges, illuminated by flickering torch lights and fire hatchy's.
         * Reports surface of an unprecedented rise in temperature within the cave, sparking concerns among the villagers.
         * Alazar's encounter with Alana, a captivating young woman, leads to a heartfelt moment when she unveils her face, revealing her stunning features, and Alazar finds himself drawn to her.
         * Alana confides in Alazar about the erratic behavior of the fire hatchy's deep within the tunnels, which have started emitting intense heat and exhibiting volatile behavior.
         * Together, they venture to the perilous edge of the scorching 'heat zone,' where a vigilant guard obstructs their progress, emphasizing the dangers that lie beyond. He informs them that no one has been able to set foot past this spot in a long time because of the rising heat levels. Alazar notices that he has the sigil of the Golden Dawn on the back of his hand. 
         * Once Alazar questions him, he begins to reveal some of  the history of the Doneldune people. He says that in ancient mythology there was a time when the people of the dunes could walk on liquid fire (lava). He said they ‘used to be made of the rock itself’ immune to the heats and able to venture deep into the molten heart of the canyon. 
         * Alazar draws the connection between the ancient myth and the masks that the Doneldune people wear. Alana reveals that there are pieces of armor that survived the last cataclysm and together they embark on  a daring mission to retrieve the scattered pieces of the revered volcanic armor, bestowed by their legendary ascended master.
         * The pieces are concealed within sacred areas spread throughout the complex network of the mines, strategically placed to shield the wearer from the escalating heat. Alazar must solve puzzles and or challenges to retrieve each piece. 
         *          * Villagers are not happy that Alazar has gathered their sacred items. If he wants to wear their precious armor, he must first prove himself in the Volcan trials. Alazar says they do not have time, but Alana doesn’t think it is a bad idea. 


The Volcan Trials
         * Alazar, driven by the urgency of the situation, must prove his mettle by competing in the rigorous Fire Trials, a series of grueling ritualistic challenges designed to test his resilience and resourcefulness.        All the people of Doneldune must pass a smaller version of these trials in order to earn their masks, like a coming of age initiation rite. But since Alazar wishes to uphold all the sacred relic armor of the past, he must prove his worth ten fold. 
         * He is required to navigate these challenges unaided, without the assistance of any specialized gear, relying solely on his wits and a single loyal hatchy companion by his side.
         * Despite the obstacles and the relentless trials he faces, Alazar perseveres, displaying unwavering determination and unwavering courage, eventually emerging triumphant alongside his trusted hatchy, Solarion. He earns the title of Flame Dancer. No one has earned that title in a long, long time. 
         * Their success in the Fire Trials grants them the privilege to don the sacred volcanic gear.
         * Empowered by their newly acquired armor, Alazar and Alana, their bond strengthened by their shared trials, go on a dangerous journey into the depths of the treacherous tunnels, shielded from the searing heat by the protective properties of the volcanic gear.
         * As they venture deeper into the labyrinthine passages, they stumble upon the Ancient Molten Reactor, a long-forgotten relic of a bygone epoch.




Molten Reactor 
         * Alazar and Alana must journey through the fire temple, and it is like a pyramid. Alazar manages to soothe a tempered Flamane adding another hatchy to his roster. 
         * They work their way through the ancient pyramid and find that a massive inner rotary cylindrical chamber has been closed which runs the entire height of the central pyramid. and that it originally was the fuel for the fire orb and allowed the lava to flow upwards. They must reactivate the rotary chamber to regulate the flow of lava and allow the land to cool once more. 
         * Inside they must face powerful hatchy Fiadra and earn its respect by beating it in battle. 
         *          * They defeat Fiadra and restore balance to the desert, claiming the fire power. Celebrations begin.
         * With Alazar’s new relationship with Alana, Rosalie feels all the more inclined to want to go with Lucius. She is waiting for him to turn up again, practicing with her void hatchy in secret. 




Raid On Doneldune
         * The celebrations end but as Alazar and main group, now including Alana are going to leave the canyon they are suddenly confronted by the Void Reaper.
         * Jemma appears as well, and an entire squad of powerful Cultist Knights and Mages. A large battle proceeds. Jemma is gravely injured trying to protect Alazar. The team retreat, allowing Lucius to make his move on the fire orb. Rosalie starts to feel guilty. 
         * Jemma reveals that the group must attack the Cultists at their heart. Also he reveals that the City of Lights exists and that  If the temple of light turns then the world is doomed. He gives Alazar his blessing, and hands over his most dear companion Knightlight before using his light powers to portal away, needing time to recover. 
         * Artarian ship appears on waters directed from the source of the hydro-nexus. It comes rushing in through the valley like a torrential river and knocks a lot of the Order members away. Roni and Shakti appear to help main group get away, with the fate of the molten reactor and Doneldune unknown.

________________


Felkyn Island 
         * Life on the ship as it proceeds to the ocean. See the roles of the Artarians and the worry of main characters as they witness a dimensional crack starting to grow in the sky. It is like an aurora borealis but made of a purple void light. Jemma’s Knightlight hasn’t gotten over his grief at losing Jemma and the team flies through the sky without direction, whilst Alazar tries to bond and speak with him, with his own team of Hatchy.
         * This is when they accidentally get sucked into some sort of Bermuda triangle type thing that disables the control of the ship. A massive whirlpool appears and they get pulled into it. They get funneled through to the other side and appear in an upside-down ocean. 
         * The group are ambushed by masked people, but their masks are very different from that of the desert tribe. They are made of wood and leaves, and the masks take up almost all of their small bodies, not just covering their face. Large masks and only used as intimidation tactic. Because the faces of the masks are so large and dispropritonate to their bodies. There are ‘scary’ faces like tibeten masks or something but they do not wear them all the time like the Doneldune people. Sprout senses something and tries to communicate but no one will listen to him. Suddenly one of the figures reveals their face and stares at sprout and group realises that the masked people are the Felkyn. All the Felkyn take off their mask as they see their long lost child Sprout. But sprout is having trouble remembering who they are, as Sprout suffers from amnesia due to the trauma of kidnap and brainwash from The Order. 
         * Felkyn take them back to their village, where they give the history of their race, and why there are so few of them left. 
         * Sprout is a lost Felkyn who wants to find his family he was separated from as a child after being taken by The Order. They reveal that Sprout was destined to be a shaman for their people, and in their tribe the shamans were the leaders, those most connected to the omni spirits and the will of nature. They said sprout disappeared one night and they waited many hundreds of years for him to return. 
         * They reveal that they are one of the few races to survive the cataclysm. No one knows the origin of when the world went into chaos, but it is a foreshadowing for the events of the titan in the future. They were hunted and used as slaves by an dark ancient order. They have high magic potential in their blood which can also be harvested. They can make trees and plants grow, no matter how barren the soil. They used to live amongst woods all across the planet, but now this island is all that is left of their people. 
         * They reveal that they can feel something changing in the earth. Something is happening, almost as if history is repeating itself. 
         * Group is surprised that Sprout is that old because he looks like a child still. But Sprout still doesn’t know how he got into the hands of the Order and is very confused. But being back on Felkyn island begins to slowly bring back memories. Some darker than others. 
         * There are all sorts of strange ancient artifacts on Felkyn island and old petroglyphs in the stones around the lush jungle. There are new Hatchy and the Felkyn reveal that there is a large hatchy who lives up in the cave mountains who has been taking Felkyn never to be seen again. 
         * Alazar and group vow that they will help the Felkyn, while Sprout goes through his existential crisis and tries to remember who he is. 
         * As the group journeys to the cave they all start to separate from each other. Time and space is bending weirdly and after some time and disorientation, Alazar whilst working with Knightlight manage to find that there is a sleeping Negato being guarded by a man who reveals himself to be an ex member of the order. 
         * He was tasked with finding and destroying the Felkyn because of the threat their race posed, as they were the last ancients left who remembered the old ways. When he was sent he found that he could not carry out the act and instead put the Negato into an eternal dream, shrouding the island and making sure the Order believed the Felkyn were gone for good. 
         * This is the anomaly exists and why the ship lost control. Negato in its dreaming state is warping space-time, causing things to malfunction. The old Order member looks like he is decaying and says that he has been bound to this purpose for thousands of years. He weakened the veil on the island in the hopes that someone might come and take up the mantle, until the day that the Order is no longer a threat to the lost races of the past. He had been operating in secret, unbeknownst to the Felkyn and Negato’s space-time interference made it impossible for anyone to reach him, even the Felkyn themselves, explaining why many had gotten lost and wandered while trying. 
         * The Felkyn that disappeared have not been harmed but have been wandering lost in the strange corridors of space time that it has created. Using Knightlights power they manage to see the true paths and rescue everyone. 
         * Sprout decides that he should take up the mantle and thanks the order member for keeping them safe all these years. But the saved Felkyn refuse to let Sprout take the mantle and promise that they will each take turns watching over the sleeping hatchy. 
         * They tell the old member that they wish to infiltrate the Land of Vune. He warns them about the Voidmancer, that she can corrupt through the mind, and doesn’t even believe they will make it past her. 
         * With his purpose dissolved the ex-order member dissolves into dust and is carried away on the wind.  
         * There is a big celebration but group knows that they still have to confront the cultists head on. 
         * Meanwhile Sprout is thriving. It is the happiest the group has seen him, to be back with his people. A lot of memories have come back to him, of his time on Felkyn island before he disappeared, but what happened after is still a mystery to him. 
         * Alazar decides they should set off right away, but Altarians say that they need a couple things to repair the ship. 


Ancient Felkyn Constructs
         * Sprout takes the group into an underground sanctuary, a sacred Felkyn location. A pair of Ancient Mechanical constructs appear and attack the group because they aren’t Felkyn. 
         * They defeat the mechanical constructs, and the group enters the sanctuary and Sprout deciphers the script on the wall. They learn more about the Felkyn, and the ascended Watchers. They learn about the dark void Titan and how they were sealed into the abyss known as the Apsu.
         * Mechanical constructs help to repair ship and are given knowledge on how to make it fly! Ship becomes upgraded to airship. Now main group has a clue as to why the Order is trying to open up a void portal in the sky. 
         * Alazar presses that the group has to move on, but Sprout is free to stay with his people. Sprout declines and says that he wants to join them, for if they do not succeed then the Felkyn people will not be long. He says it is his duty as their shaman to protect his people and ensure that they can return to the world in peace. Group set off towards Cultist headquarters, waving goodbye to the small Felkyn and using construct additions to bypass the space-time folds that the sleeping hatchy is creating.

Sky Labyrinth 
         * The crew is flying along when suddenly Aliya wakes up and wanders to the edge of the airship. She looks out and suddenly in the night sky she sees her reflection like a large invisible mirror is floating there. 
         * She turns around and sees more reflections. Soon she and the airship are surrounded by reflections like an infinite mirror maze. The Artarian pirate crew begin to call out as they try to navigate through the mirrors. They start bumping into invisible mirror walls and it wakes up the whole ship. Alazar and main crew rush up to the top deck. 
         * Alazar and Aliya must work together to navigate their way through the mirror maze. 


The Broken City of Lights        
         * When they finally get through, they arrive at the city of lights. But everything is strange, cast in a monochrome black and white. Like the city is broken. There are crumbling ruins of light, made of a strange material that looks like light has solidified into stone. The whole city is surrounded by a dome of mirrors which make it invisible from the outside. This is apparently a myth amongst the Elves, that they used to originally inhabit the city of light all those thousands of years ago with the Titan of light who gave them their priestess powers of healing and true sight,
         * They did not know that it still existed. They explore the abandoned city and Aliya ends up alone, finding her way goes to the large central citadel building. It is locked and they have to find a way to reflect lights through mirrors to open the doorway. 


The Dying Heartstar
         * Aliya find a dim orb-like sun in the center of the citadel room. Surrounded by a dyson sphere orrery, but it is barely working. realizes that this was the mythical eternal sun her people spoke about in myths. But its light was going out. Something was wrong. The entire city is abandoned and falling apart. Below the sun is a clear glass that can see the ocean below. She sees that when parts of the city crumble off, they fall to the ocean in a stream of light, before extinguishing. 
         * Jemma’s Knightlight, now Alazar’s appears beside her. She turns to him questioningly and Alazar comes in behind them with Alana. They realize they have to activate the sun again somehow. This is when Knightlight casts a light spell that activates a grid on the ground. It shows a map of the leylines but main characters don’t know what it is. Some of the ley lines are still white, but others are in shadow. They do not know what it means. A pedestal rises up and Alazar realizes it is meant for the omni sword. He tries to put it in, but in attempt to activate sends him flying backwards. Aliya realizes the omni sword is not at its full power. They need to fix it before they can activate whatever the pedestal does. 
         * But Aliya is getting a different kind of intuition and when she touches her hand to the sun she feels a voice talking back to her. Before group can do anything her eyes light up and she walks right into it. Alazar tries to run and get her back, but the sun is solid and cold to the touch.


Ancestors of Light Initiation
         * Aliya activates when she touches it. to go through a Trial to prove her worthiness to the Light. 
         * She is tested for her knowledge, her morality, and her combat prowess before forced to look into the Mirror that reveals her shadows and insecurities. There hasn’t been a full priestess amongst the elves in thousands of years and she is to be the first so she needs to be completely purified in the light. She is now no longer a Trainee Priestess, and meets the eternal elders who still live in the light. She is shown where the light temple is, and how to reach it within the city. 
         * When she overcomes her trial she remerges glowing and radiant and fuels the sun to which it makes the city shimmer. Though the ley-line grid does not change. This awakens the memory of the citadel. Fragments of elves, made of projections of light, like holograms. They are not real anymore, speaking through memories but they have their own personalities and can be interacted with. But they are like the bleach spot the sun leaves behind in the eye if you stare at it for too long. Aliya meets her ancient ancestors, and they renew her with a new sense of power and connection to the Light magic. 
         * Aliya proposes Alazar to enter the Heart Star and get the Light Elementals blessing, which they accept. The crew go through the Heart Star. The Heart Star has a series of light prisms and puzzles.
         * After completion, the Light Elemental Spirit gives Alazar the blessing, and restores Omni Sword. Teaches them the importance of seeing through illusions and the power to reveal the truth. A bright light shines as the Light Elemental blesses Alazar.
         * Alazar now tries to activate the pedestal and light runs through the ley line grid, only to be blocked by the void crystals that the Order have been laying down. City has been restored, to rainbow hue brilliance.
         * This opens the doorway to the Infinte Library. Main group can venture in here. There are infinite tomes that stretch up eternally into the sky, with  the floating memories drifting from shelf to shelf. This was the original inhabitance of the Voidmancer. They find a notebook of hers, depicting more of her lore. From here they can see down and look at all the places they have been. Above them, through the invisible ceiling they can see the dimensional crack. 
         * Aliyah keeps the Voidmancers old journal and notebook. She feels a kinship to the old Queen and there are lots of mirrors in her former self. It is revealed that the voidmancer was once related to Aliyah.

         * alazar is given knowledge to enter the void
         * he speaks to the watchers
         * the void temple summoned
-
Alazar and his team, including a new member from the thief guild hoping to become an assassin one day, must defeat a group of dark elemental wraiths that have taken over a temple and are blocking access to the elemental power. Before they can face the wraiths, they must solve a puzzle involving the properties of darkness to unlock the door to the inner sanctum. The puzzle consists of a series of traps, buttons, switches, levers and illusions that test their teamwork and ability to use deceit and dark tactics in noble ways. To unlock the door, they must use their wits and creativity to overcome the traps and a way through the labyrinth.
Inside the inner sanctum, they must defeat the wraiths to claim the elemental power. The wraiths are able to control and manipulate darkness, using it to obscure their movements and create illusions that instill fear in their opponents. To defeat the wraiths, the group must use their other elemental powers and strategies to overcome their fear and reveal the wraiths' movements. They discover that the wraiths are vulnerable to light attacks, so they use smoke and their light elemental powers to shatter the illusions and defeat the wraiths.
The elemental spirit rewards Alazar with a weapon imbued with dark elemental power and teaches him the lesson that what seems dark can be a matter of perspective and that some creatures must think creatively and use tactics that may seem deceitful or dark in order to survive. They also learn that all life deserves a means of expressing itself and feeling secure, and that sometimes this means living in conditions that may be damaging to others or avoided by others. The weapon, named the Shadowfang, has the ability to release a poisonous cloud that can debilitate enemies and make them more susceptible to attacks. The Shadowfang also has the ability to create a shield that protects the wielder from poison attacks and can absorb poison, increasing its power and allowing it to unleash a devastating poison blast attack.

            * the void temple is guarded by a corrupted spirit
Alazar and his team must defeat a group of void elemental wraiths that have taken over a temple and are blocking access to the elemental power. Before they can face the wraiths, they must solve a puzzle involving the properties of the void element to unlock the door to the inner sanctum. The puzzle consists of a series of portals that lead to different dimensions, each with its own challenges and obstacles. To unlock the door, they must navigate through the dimensions and find the hidden key that unlocks the door.
Inside the inner sanctum, they must defeat the wraiths to claim the elemental power. The wraiths are able to control and manipulate the void element, using it to warp reality and access the power of all the other elements. To defeat the wraiths, the group must use their other elemental powers and strategies to counter the wraiths' abilities and reveal their movements. They discover that the wraiths are vulnerable to attacks that disrupt their access to the void element, so they use their void elemental powers to sever the wraiths' connection to the void and defeat them.
The elemental spirit rewards Alazar with a weapon imbued with void elemental power and teaches him the lesson that the void element is a powerful and unpredictable force that can be harnessed for good or ill. The weapon, named the Warpblade, has the ability to create portals that allow the wielder to teleport short distances and access other dimensions. The Warpblade also has the ability to combine the power of all the other elements and unleash a devastating attack that can bend reality and negate the effects of other attacks.


________________


Across the Aether Void
            * Not sure on how to stop the Elder and his plans, the group are suddenly confronted at the City of Lights by Lucius. 
            * Alazar jumps to fight him, but he drops to his knees. He never wanted Rosalie to die, and he has finally awoken to the darkness of the Elder’s plans. He was raised from birth to follow the Elder and he wished he had seen that he was being used earlier. He tells the group that he can get them through the Void splinter.
            * Not sure if to trust him, the main group decides to at least allow Lucius to get them through the Void splinter. He tells them that he can get them inside, but once they are in, they will need something miraculous to overcome the void being that dwells within. 
            * Lucius surrounds the artarian airship with a veil of void, which allows them to enter the Void splinter. 


The Watchers
            * Once they enter they are taken through trippy, psychedelic void wormhole. Allow players to dodge tentacles and debris as they are ushered through at hyperspeed. 
            * It is like a tunnel and in the walls of the tunnels are thousands of eyes blinking and watching them. 
            * Now that they have broken through the third dimension into the fourth, the multidimensional watchers, descendants of the omni binding the universe together into a unified law, by their continued observance (tie in quantum theory). 
            * The watchers have observed eternity and as they pass through the wormhole, all members of the main group are forced to ‘communicate’ with the watchers. They do not speak, but merely being in their awareness, folds all eternity they have observed and is transmitted to their minds. Eternity is too large to grasp, and they struggle to keep their sanity as the watcher’s commune. 
            * Through the infiltration of Alazar’s mind we see him overcoming the crushing weight of eternity and navigates through the folds to parse out specific fragments of the eternity. He wants to know how to defeat the Elder. This is where we get to see more of how the Elder grew corrupted. His origins and how he once faced the watchers as well. 
            * Main group is getting overwhelmed but this is when the Voidmancer’s old notebook comes in handy and she uses light to dispel and blind the watchers, so their gaze can no longer penetrate their minds. 
            * Main group make it through the wormhole and are spit out into the dark void-purple waters of the Apsu. 


The Apsu
            * Alazar and main group reach the Gates of Asin, where they are met by a massive celestial being with a jackals head. A slave bound to guard the void realm for eternity, until one sets him free. Group must answer riddles correctly and give something of themselves that makes them weaker.
            * Lucius stands forward and gives his void powers. Which pays and grants the entire group access, but leave Lucius weak and frail. 
            * Once they are past the Gate they can fly towards the Precipice outpost. 
            * Can introduce undead abyssals here. Once they are through the gates the abyssals can manifest from the void or appear and attack while they are flying. Lucius will not be able to control or battle with. 


Precipice Outpost
            * The floating tower stands isolated amidst the expanse of the void, its colossal structure like a massive asteroid that is actually the skull remnants of some ancient primal being. At its zenith, a solitary glass eye serves as the sole conduit for navigating the chaotic terrain of the void, providing a glimpse into the otherwise impenetrable nothingness that envelops the tower.
            * The journey to the apex of the tower is extremely dangerous. There are enemies and intricate obstacles that challenge the characters at every turn. They must confront an array of guardians and overcome complex trials, can also go against abyssals, each more perilous than the last, as they ascend toward the summit.
            * Utilizing the resources of the precipice outpost, the main crew strategize their approach, mapping out their path.Their efforts reveal a crucial revelation – the glass eye possesses the unique ability to illuminate a safe passage through the void realm, guiding them along a specific trajectory that prevents them from wandering astray and getting lost in the fray.
            * As they activate the glass eye, its radiance penetrates the void, creating a pathway that materializes through the void. The characters must stick to the path and not stray as void hatchy try to pull them off the track, their senses assailed and disoriented. 
            * Void hatchy, appears and manipulates Alazar’s mind and group with illusions. Illusions distort Alazar’s memories, self-esteem, and worth, attempting to manipulate him. We are taken through various flashbacks of Alazar’s past, whilst the fringes of his mind glitch back to the path. Alazar resists and escapes Void hatchy mind prison, he helps the rest of the group come back to their senses and they defeat the void hatchy, finally arriving at the Ultraviolet Meteor fields.


Ultraviolet Meteor Fields


            * The Ultraviolet Meteor Fields unfold as ever-shifting terrain of swirling void and undulating grey sands. The remnants of once-majestic structures lie buried beneath the shifting dunes, while ultraviolet meteors cascade and leave trails of shimmering fuschia streaks in the sky.
            * Some of the meteor impacts give rise to void hatchys, and abyssals that emerge from the meteoric debris, forcing the group to engage in relentless skirmishes as they traverse the fields.
            * Navigating the treacherous terrain demands they follow guidance provided by ancient marker posts. Carved statues of sword-wielding figures, reminiscent of the distinct design of the omni sword, direct the group.
            * Following the trail dictated by the markers, the crew move through the hazardous Ultraviolet Meteor Fields. 
            * Pressing onward with unwavering resolve, the group perseveres until they eventually arrive at the fabled Lost Sinking City of Sherulia. 






Lost City of Sherulia 
            * Group must sneak into the city as it is guarded by a high wall and Cultist members. 
            * The group is stunned to find that HUMANS are living in the city, being forced to work and oppressed by the cultists. 
            * Meet a shifty character who recognises them as outsiders and take them to a secret rebel base under the ground. 
            * It is there that a character recognises Alazar and Solarion. He is an old man, and half of him has been replaced by the void magic equivalent of robotics. Artificial body with void ether running through. 
            * He has been waiting. It is revealed that Alazar was from this world. That he and his parents lived together in the once great city of Sherulia. It was a beautiful nation full of light and peace. That was until the Elder appeared. He came from another world, and brought in an ancient Titan. It almost destroyed the world until…
            * Jemma appears. Group are shocked to see him, rebels bow. Jemma continues the story, saying that they were too weak to defeat the Titan. There was only one way to stop it and Jemma and Alazar’s parents conducted a Light ritual imbuing the last remnants of their dying star into Alazar, and sending him away to another world so he the light could grow inside him. 
            * Jemma then managed to seal this realm away from the others and thus locking the Titan into a slumber, casting the Elder known as Psiliax away. But Psiliax was sent back in time and landed in the world where Alazar was sent. He was defeated and weakened, but given the time to build his army of cultists up again. 
            * Jemma formed his own coalition of the Golden Dawn to try and stop the Elder. 
            * Unfortunately Alazar’s parents were killed in the final effort to save Alazar. And on the same night, Lucius was born, from the efforts of Psiliax. Psiliax’s plan was to sacrifice his own child to bring about the full revival of the Titan. But now that Lucius is no longer aligned with him, he will be resorting to more drastic measures. 
            * Alazar visits his parents tombs and something awakens in him and through the Omni sword. Alazar can now bring light into the void whenever he wants. 
            * Using this power he must liberate the city, by activating the ancient Sherulian crystals using the Omni sword as a frequency key.  
            * Cultists are cast of Sherulia and city is given their light back. Now they must confront Psiliax before he can awaken the Titan once more. 


Slumbering Titan
            * The great Titan of the Void is larger than the entire city, bigger than worlds. Unbound in this realm it is a being of monumental size. It is in an eternally restless sleep, and as main group ventures towards it, they see closed eye lids with eyes constantly darting back and forth behind the eye lids. 
            * Psiliax is there with his cultists and the ancient vimana flying above in front of it’s face. 
            * Psiliax turns to them and big reveal that address Jemma as his brother. It is a big shock and we have cut scene of Jemma and Psiliax learning the powers of the universe as children in an unknown world. 
            * We see Jemma learning beautiful magic and helping people. Whilst Psiliax goes down the dark route. Twisting the beauty of void magic to his dark intentions. 
            * Psiliax is also furious that Lucius has betrayed him and given up his powers. He sends his cultists to attack while he starts a waking ritual. 


Psiliax’s Ascension
            * Manage to defeat cultists and attack Psiliax, but right at the last moment Psiliax sacrifices his own life, in a great ritual, and transcends, killing the slumbering consciousness of the Titan and becoming the Titan himself. 
            * The void power is unleashed and Titan Psiliax seems unstoppable. Alazar calls in the golden light to try and subdue Titan Psiliax, but it is not enough. He tears open the void splinter and we can see through the portal straight to the original world. 


Great Cataclysm 
            * A great Cataclysm hits all of the world, and void is unleashed. Cities and villages burn. All the people we met along the way die. They have lost. 
            * All becomes void.


The Halls of Almega
            * Out of the darkness a single eye appears. Then phases in the body of Almega. He looks around at the nothingness of the Void, and sees Psiliax consuming all light and making for the other world. He shakes his head, casts magic and suddenly the timeline splinters. 
            * Visual infinite timeline depiction, scrolling through them like the pages of a book. From the void he pulls forward the dead body of Alazar and Lucius and zips away to the Halls of Omni. 
            * In their spirit forms Alazar and Lucius are resurrected. Can have a great interaction with Omni, the multidimensional creator, and have a cool conversation on the cycles of time and space.
            * Almega is no longer a single form, but lives within the eternally endless halls bound to the will of the Omni as a multidimensional entity (Reference Image:)
  

Like this but with and entity Omni face everywhere. 
            * In these halls Lucius and Alazar float, and come back to consciousness, where they interact with the trickster, type archetype of Almega and he reveals that he is not meant to intervene, but Psiliax is damaging all future timelines and a little nudge in the right direction never hurts anyone. 
            * Alazar reveals his power was not enough to stop Psiliax, and Lucius gave up his power. 
            * It was never Alazar’s fight to face alone. Both find that their powers are restored, and Almega reveals that they must face Psiliax together. Light and void were once two sides of the same coin. But the foolish ways of Jemma and Psiliax divided the two elements in both their wills to let the other prevail. They must work together in balance. Lucius and Alazar are brothers in soul. They must defeat Psiliax on their own. 
            * Almega swirls and another trippy wormhole effect where they fall back through time and into space.


Time Alter
            *  Or so they think. Alazar and Lucius both wake in a glass box surrounded by golden gears. There is one large central console in the middle of the room. 
            * They recognise each other and all the struggles they have both been through and together they pull the crank of time, rewinding it all to the moment before Psiliax destroys the worlds. 
            * We relive those moments again accept Alazar and Lucius know what to do. They burst into the void sky, flying with their newly awakened powers and together knock the titan into another dimension to fight him on their own. 


The Starless Space
            * Big battle with Psiliax. A battle using their new powers, allowing for them to mix combos of light and void together. This is first phase of fight. 
            * Then titan unleashes true terrifying form. Splayed tentacle monstrosity with millions of razor teeth. Can cause black holes, suck players towards mouth to consume. They must dodge and avoid attacks while doing damage. 
            * Final stage of ultimate boss battle is like a retro space shooter. Psiliax sends out attacks and flying together Alazar and Lucius combine to form a new element. 
            * Light and void together make Ether Plasma. 
            * With the Plasma they are able to defeat Psiliax and the void titan is vanquished. 


Prologue
            * With Titan defeated. Alazar and Lucius return to void realm. There are celebrations in Sherulia. But with the city still sinking people are eventually evacuated onto the Artarian Skyship. Celebrations occur, but they could not save Rosalie. 
            * Return to main world, seal up void splinter and Sherulians settle in the City of Light. 
            * Alazar and crew take Lucius to Rosalie’s grave. 
            * Jemma bids the crew farewell and leaves the world, giving Alazar something that will allow him to visit him someday. 
            * Alazar and crew leave Lucius at Rosalie’s grave and go and sit on the edge of a cliff, looking out onto the world they saved. 
________________




Land of Vune 
            * The journey into the land of Vune presents Alazar and his crew with an intricate challenge. As they approach the mysterious island, they realize that accessing the cultists' mansion is not a simple task. The mansion appears to be shielded by powerful enchantments, rendering it impenetrable without a specific magical key or signature.
            * Faced with this obstacle, they realise that their only alternative is to venture into the treacherous twilight sands, an area shrouded in an eerie, perpetual dusk. Navigating through this ethereal landscape poses its own set of dangers, from shifting dunes to hidden perils that lurk beneath the surface.
            * Their quest leads them to the discovery of the floating voidmancer’s lair, a master of the dark arts. To gain entry into the Voidmancer's lair, Alazar and crew must first locate a concealed cave, a place rumored to hold the key to unlocking the secret to the ritual summoning portal.
            * Upon finding the elusive cave, the adventurers uncover ancient inscriptions and cryptic clues that guide them in their next endeavor. They learn that activating the ritual summoning portal requires the activation of three distinct void pillars, scattered across the twilight sands. Each pillar possesses its own intricate mechanism, guarded by magical traps and guardians.
            * Alazar and his crew successfully activate the three void pillars, triggering a luminous summoning sigil to materialize beneath their feet. As the sigil illuminates the ground, a powerful surge of energy envelops them, transporting them in an instant to the elevated domain of the Voidmancer's lair. 


Voidmancer’s Lair
            * It is a dark necropolis temple, where all sorts of void experiments are going on. From corrupting hatchy to the alchemical production of the void crystals which have been planted on the ley lines. 
            * Must navigate the confusing layout, full with penrose staircase, illusion of staircases going upside down, and looping around on themselves. Must activate different switches to arrange the right layout. 
            * There is one main void door that they have to get open. There are five void sigil symbols above the door that players must illuminate one by one. 
            * Once completed they can enter the Voidmancers Sanctum. This is where they have to fight the Voidmancer. A being completely transformed by void ritual. Once a woman, now something completely different. She has void limbs like a spider, and has void webs and other abilities to ensnare, freeze battle, and poison the main crew. 
            * *Voidmancer Lore* - Must integrate throughout the text, through Jemma and through cultists, and Lucian. The voidmancer was not always this way. In fact she was once a woman. A beautiful woman, with long blonde hair. She was the Golden Dawn’s first Queen. Born with a golden heart, she used to be a source of light, wisdom, and inspiration to all. Her initial view of the world was inspired by her time with the Elves of light in the floating City of light. She could see the entire world from the inner sanctum of her library. She saw that there was chaos and unrest and created the Order of the Golden Dawn to span across multiple timelines and world to achieve harmony and peace. That was until she fell in love. The Elder was a young charming man, many thousands of years ago, before the first cataclysm and before he extended his life with dark practices. He was a human and she an Elf, but his heart was noble, or at least so she thought. 
            * At first he believed in her cause, but the more he travelled, the more he learned, and eventually the titan of the void managed to get into his mind. Slowly he began to change, and with her undying love for him, she had bound herself to him. As the Elder’s soul corrupted, he began to do experiments on her. Slowly she became less and less of herself until she became what we know today as the voidmancer, turning against her purpose, and losing herself to the negatives of the void. 
            * At first abilities do little to no damage and Alazar must use the omni sword to temporarily draw down a pillar of light that suddenly makes the Voidmancer vulnerable. This can be done in multiple stages to elongate the fight. 
            * Once defeated, voidmancer drops the magic sigil key that allows them access to the Cultists mansion. As well as providing group with various void artifacts and armor. Void armor offers high stat boosts, but with also negative side effects.  For example increasing damage drastically while reducing hp or defense stats. 


Cultists Mansion
            * A huge complex riddled with guards and cultists. It will be a challenge to navigate, especially with reduced damage on light effects, and enemy void armor bonuses. Void items should enable better damage, and any non-light hatchy still do normal damage. 
            * It is like a haunted mansion with floating void candles and people that have been transformed more into phantoms, with their void hatchy to defend. 
            * The goal is to navigate the various mansion rooms, and find keys to descend down to the basement. The deeper they go the less ornamental the place becomes, and more dungeon/occult activity appears. Must interrupt cultists in their rituals, defeat them, and ultimately make the way down to the heart of Vune. 
            * It is a magical dungeon where Elder spends all his time. It is just like the other energy points they have encountered along the way. There is a large orb in the center with a pillar of void light shooting up towards the sky, surrounding Vune in the dome and also feeding the crack of dimensions in the sky. 
            * Encounter Elder face to face for the first time. He is challenged but he laughs main group off like they are nothing. Before showing his true power. He utter decimates the ceiling and tears through the entire mansion, destroying it in one swift movement. Then from beneath the ancient temple upon which the mansion sat upon rises up to reveal that it was a vimana this entire time. It floats up into the sky with them on it and Elder reveals his near endless power. 
            * The Void Reaper appears again, with Lucius (who looks darkened and sunken, like they have done something to him, eyes black and full of void. We must fight them together, and Lucius is much more powerful here than he ever was in the other parts of the timeline, because of all the void energy fueling him. 
            * Once defeated Rosalie will run over to Lucius who has been snapped out of his void trance, and try to bring him back to himself. There is a moment of reaching out, of showing love. But Elder tells main group it doesn’t matter. He only sent out Lucius to buy them time. For now their plan is complete. All he needs is a sacrifice. 
            * He orders Lucius to bring him Rosalie. But Lucius refuses. Saying No to the Elder for the first time. This is his major denial of the destiny that has been set out for him, and the mark of him carving his own. Elder casts him aside, throwing him off the vimana and orders instead the Void Reaper. In his wounded state he obliges, but to his detriment, as both Rosalie and him are sacrificed and killed. 
            * This traumatises the main party, but before they have the time to react, a massive pillar of void energy splinters the dimension above, opening it enough for the Elder to go through. With a blast of void energy he knocks the main group off and flies up towards the Void splinter. 


Void Splinter


            * Meanwhile we see through a dark orb that appears, a network of leylines all activating in purple void, and surging to large nodes, that include the pyramid, molten reactor, and hydro nexus. They all turn void in an instant. 
            * Void splinter tears across the sky, and tendrils of void come wriggling out, blocking out the light of the moon. It is sucking up with gravity parts of the world.  Cut scene as main group watch in shock and horror as the Elder flies into it with ancient vimana. They think they have failed that it is too late, and Alazar holds Rosalie’s dead body. 
            * Entire world shakes and everything in Vune begins to crumble. 


Escape from Vune
            * Must run and jump over obstacles, and escape before Vune is sucked up entirely into the Void splinter. 
            * Once they escape they do not know what to do, and return to Ishinomori, thinking they have failed, burying Rosalie’s body and having a funeral as they await the last coming of days.

• Alazaar was killed by a large sword that went from his chest to his stomach.
• The Solarion left Alazaar's body and became an egg.
• All troops are sad, and they are trying to heal Alazaar. Aliya, who has no strength, doesn't join and can only cry from a distance.
• Jemma appears and says she saw Alazaar possessing an item that only exists in the world.
• That item is an item left by Alazaar's parents that Alazaar gave him when Alazaar was a baby.
• Jemma said if all the prayers and enthusiasm of everyone in the place were pooled into that item, Alazaar could come back to life but with a consequence it might fail.
• The Chaos God who had suddenly resurrected after being defeated by Alazaar apparently heard and saw all of that from his personality stored in his heart.
• After he managed to destroy the power of the Ego that was constantly affirming him, Chaos God said that he would donate all of his power so that Alazaar could be 100% alive without any consequences.
• Many doubted, but Jemma believed Chaos God had changed. He agreed.
• With the additional energy from the Chaos God, more than enough spirits could accumulate in Alazaar's parents' relics.
• Alazaar revived, but it broke due to the excess energy.
• Chaos God died after donating all of his energy.
