Hey @Jomari - here's the draft announcement I have for the DAO Council along with a linked google interest form, any changes or suggestions on your part on any of it? 
***
We are excited to announce that we will be formally establishing the Hatchyverse DAO and a Hatchy Community Growth (HCG) Council. There will be up to 10 members in the Council and its charge will be to build out the DAO infrastructure and work on initiatives to propel the growth of the Hatchyverse brand towards a top 100 IP. The Council members will have roles in one of three areas: Administration, Development, and Marketing. The members of these focus areas will work together to develop a cohesive strategy, set KPIs, and have overlap but each area will have focus areas as follows: 

Administration: DAO operations management & strategy, business development, external funding
Development: tools and technical infrastructure to support growth initiatives 
Marketing: networking/partnerships, socials platform expansion, content creation & strategy

We have identified several members for each DAO as follows:

adminDAO - Jomari, zojoloco
devDAO - Sols, alpmy, seadox
marketingDAO - Thundaz, TheMadHatter

We have up to 3 remaining slots to fill - any interested community members should respond by filling out the google form here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfc7dsxJYhMFRAPOMXaGNcoW0YO64QOQho5_oQEwlMRCb_A0w/viewform

Initial DAO HCG Council appointments will be for 1 year, with subsequent appointments based on election by $HATCHY token holders. HCG Council members will be compensated in $HATCHY by reducing the runway on the staking pool, with max compensation to be $5M HATCHY/yr per member for Year 1. Appointments are not guaranteed and council members may be removed for inactivity. The allocation of $HATCHY to council members will have no impact on the current emissions rate, but will reduce the runway by 1 year for each year at this level (current runway will go from approximately 10 years to 9 years). Subsequent years' council compensation will be re-evaluated each year taking into account KPI success, token price, etc. We believe this initiative is vital to ensure that Hatchyverse is positioned to maximize our reach and capabilities for maximum growth during the bull market as well as to establish a sustainable framework for continued community stewardship of the Hatchyverse brand for years to come.
