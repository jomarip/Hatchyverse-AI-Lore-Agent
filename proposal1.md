Background:

Hatchyverse is an expanding global team of game developers with a vision to revolutionize media creation, particularly in games, movies, books, and more. Despite having multiple games in development, a comic book, and a card game, the organization faces challenges in marketing and content creation. This proposal aims to address these challenges by establishing a committee to incentivize and empower the community to create content, particularly focusing on video content creators.

Objective:

The primary goal of this proposal is to increase awareness of Hatchyverse, incentivize desired behaviors within the community, and minimize the pressure on any single individual by empowering the community to achieve the organization's goals. The ultimate aim is to help make the Hatchyverse brand a top 100 IP.

Proposal Details:

Establishment of the Content Creation Bounty Committee:

A committee will be formed to oversee the allocation of bounties for content creation.
The committee will consist of $HATCHY holders and replaceable by the Hatchyverse Community, ensuring a democratic and fair process.
The committee will have the authority to assign bounties for specific content creation tasks that align with the goals of the DAO.

Funding:
An initial allocation of 10 million Hatchy tokens will be dedicated to funding these bounties.
The committee will manage the distribution of these funds, ensuring they are used effectively to promote Hatchyverse.

Focus Areas:
The primary focus will be on video content creators who can utilize existing assets from games, the website, and other media to create engaging and cohesive content.
Additional bounties may be assigned for tweets, articles, tutorials, and other forms of content that contribute to the DAO's objectives.

Bounty Assignment and Distribution:
The committee will identify key content needs and set bounties accordingly.
Community members can claim these bounties by submitting their work for review.
The committee will evaluate submissions based on predefined criteria and award bounties to the best entries.

Evaluation and Reporting:
The committee will provide regular updates to the Hatchy holders on the progress of the bounty program.
A transparent reporting system will be implemented to ensure accountability and track the effectiveness of the bounties in achieving the DAO's goals.
Benefits:

Increased Awareness:
By incentivizing content creation, Hatchyverse will gain more visibility and attract a larger audience.

Community Empowerment:
The bounty program will empower community members to actively contribute to the growth and success of Hatchyverse.

Efficient Resource Utilization: The program will leverage community talent and creativity, reducing the need for substantial funding for marketing and content creation.

Goal Alignment: The bounty program will align community efforts with the overarching goals of the DAO, ensuring cohesive and strategic growth.
