## Define what constitutes the Hatchy DAO
- The Hatchy DAO is the decentralized ownership structure of the Hatchyverse IP, managed through $HATCHY token holders
- It consists of 1 billion tokens representing 100% ownership of the IP
- The DAO includes three main councils: Administration, Development, and Marketing
- Current council members include:
  - adminDAO: Jomari, zojoloco, sols
  - devDAO: Sols, alply, seadox, theWatcher
  - marketingDAO: Thundaz, TheMadHatter, Jomari, theWatcher, FloridaMan, sols

## What is its purpose?
- To manage and control the Hatchyverse intellectual property and brand
- To build out DAO infrastructure
- To propel the growth of Hatchyverse brand towards becoming a top 100 IP
- To provide a framework for community stewardship of the Hatchyverse brand
- To authorize and manage usage rights of the Hatchyverse IP

## What is its point for decision making?
- Decisions are made through token-weighted voting, where each $HATCHY token represents equal voting power
- The DAO can vote on:
  - Usage rules and licensing
  - Brand management decisions
  - Potential revocation of usage rights
  - Strategic initiatives and proposals
- To date, there has been one major DAO vote:
  - The Content Creation Bounty Committee proposal, which passed with 227m votes (100% in favor)
  - This established a committee to oversee allocation of 10 million Hatchy tokens for content creation bounties

## What is its organizational hierarchy?
- Token Holders: Base level of governance through $HATCHY ownership
- HCG (Hatchy Community Growth) Council: Up to 10 members divided into three focus areas:
  - Administration: DAO operations management, strategy, business development
  - Development: Technical infrastructure and tools
  - Marketing: Networking, partnerships, social platforms, content creation

## Is it used for day to day function and decisions or a global decision maker via vote for larger business decisions?
Based on the available information, it appears to be both:
- Day-to-day operations are handled by the HCG Council members in their respective areas
- Larger decisions are put to token holder votes
- Currently, only one proposal has gone through the voting process (Content Creation Bounty Committee)
- Most operational decisions are handled by the respective councils

## Is it just a DAO that collects the IP revenue based on the amount of $Hatchy each investor has and all decisions are made by the current leadership structure?
No, it's more comprehensive:
- The DAO receives 10% licensing fee after products reach 300k revenue
- Revenue distribution: 9% to DAO token holders, 1% to DAO reserve
- Token holders have voting rights on major decisions
- The leadership structure (HCG Council) manages operations but doesn't have unilateral decision-making power

## What is the purpose of the councils?
The HCG Council's purposes are:
- Build out the DAO infrastructure
- Work on growth initiatives
- Develop cohesive strategy
- Set and track KPIs
- Manage their respective areas (Admin/Dev/Marketing)
- Receive compensation (potentially up to $5M HATCHY/yr per member for Year 1)

## As we grow, does the DAO need to be refined?
Based on the current structure:
- Council appointments are initially for 1 year, with subsequent appointments based on election by $HATCHY token holders
- Council compensation is re-evaluated yearly based on KPI success and token price
- Council members can be removed for inactivity
- The framework is designed to be sustainable for "continued community stewardship of the Hatchyverse brand for years to come"

## What is the relationship between the DAO and existing products?
The relationship varies by product type:
- NFTs (Gen1, Gen2, Masters/Items):
  - NFT royalties are owned by the teams that created the NFTs
  - These royalties do not automatically go to the DAO
  - The conceptual IP of the NFTs falls under DAO ownership, while the commercialized product remains separate
- Games and Future Products:
  - Subject to the 10% licensing fee after reaching 300k revenue
  - Must adhere to DAO usage rules and brand guidelines
  - Can be subject to usage rights revocation by community vote
- All Products:
  - Must follow DAO-established brand usage guidelines
  - Are part of the broader Hatchyverse ecosystem
  - Contribute to the goal of becoming a top 100 IP
